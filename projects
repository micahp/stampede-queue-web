The planned computations involve extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of STARD4-membrane systems and are required to achieve specific aims of the NIH grant R37 DK27083, PI Frederick Maxfield, Department of Biochemistry, Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). \nThe physiological role of the soluble protein domain STARD4 is to transfer sterol molecules between membranes of different cellular organelles. The proposal seeks to determine the mechanistic role that different types of inositol lipids in the membrane have in functional mechanism of STARD4. Studies in the PIs lab have established that in order to accomplish the transfer function, the STARD4 protein is selectively targeted to membrane domains enriched in anionic lipids by a region rich in basic residues. An intriguing observation is the differential regulation of STARD4 activity by two different but closely related lipid components of the membrane, PIP(4,5)2 and PIP(3,5)2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and 3,5-bisphosphate, respectively). The difference is all the more remarkable as these two physiologically important lipid components carry the same highly negative net charge. Preliminary computations performed by the co-PI, George Khelashvili (Department of Physiology and Biophysics, WCMC), have already identified specific locations on the STARD4 protein that are engaged in strong electrostatic interactions with PIP(4,5)2 lipids, and showed how mutations in STARD4 found in our experiments to inhibit function, can modulate these interactions. To accomplish the Specific Aims of the NIH grant supporting this work we have designed collaboratively a series of computational experiments building on these preliminary mechanistic studies, that require the large-scale MD simulations described in this allocation request.The computational work will be carried out in the Khelashvili lab following the collaborative protocols we have established, integrated with the cognate experiments. The protocols we have designed will i) investigate how the interactions with the various lipid components position the STARD4 domain at the membrane and prepare it for sterol binding/release events; and ii) establish a rigorous structural and dynamic context for the experimentally observed differential regulation of STARD4 activity by different inositol lipid types, and how various mutations affect such regulation.

Building upon the substantial advancements we have made in the first 2 years of this LRAC award, we will continue our simulations of high mass star formation by extending our study of collapse and fragmentation of turbulent cores with no outflows and single-frequency radiation to explore a larger number of realizations and a wider range of parameters.\nWe will include for the first time, the combined effect of feedback from radiation and its interaction with feedback from protostellar outflows in an effort to pin down a mapping between the properties of cores and their environments such as column density, and the masses and multiplicities of the stellar systems to which they collapse.  The first exploratory simulations with ionization will be performed. We will also continue our ground breaking studies of multiple low mass star formation by studying the collapse of magnetized turbulent clumps with AMR and comparing results to our pure hydrodynamic models to gauge the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process. In addition, we will perform the same simulation with a 1000 solar mass turbulent clump that we have used in our current studies of star formation in turbulent clumps (Offner, Klein and McKee, 2008) but with magnetic fields. This study, now including magnetic fields, will complement our studies of core and star formation this current year without fields and enable us to delineate the effects of magnetic fields on star formation. To explore the effects of outflows on low mass star formation, we will also perform high-resolution AMR simulations of cluster formation including the feedback from such outflows using stellar evolutionary and wind feedback models. To do these simulations we will take advantage of our implementation of sink particles in Eulerian grids, which we have previously used to handle stellar evolution and feedback in our studies of high mass star formation. We will continue simulations of low mass star formation with radiative transfer, thereby addressing the effect of radiation feedback on core fragmentation and stellar multiplicity, first using our grey flux-limited implementation (GFLD) in ORION and then comparing with simulations using our newly developed Multi-Frequency Grey radiation transfer.

The key to designing new materials is a good understanding of the relationship between the material structure and its function.  Theory and modeling are playing an increasingly important role in determining these structure-function relationships.

For Li-ion battery materials, the binding of Li determines the cell voltage and diffusion barriers determine the potential current density.  Enabled with reactivity descriptors, computational methods can be used to rapidly screen and search for new materials.  In this project, existing collaborations with synthetic and analytical chemists will be leveraged to validate reactivity descriptors on functional materials for energy conversion and storage.

The devices of interest use shapes that  are small and closely spaced and hence require detailed direct numerical  simulation of the near surface flow to capture the physics.  We have already carried out simulations of configurations involving  synthetic jets and of small wall jets blowing/sucking below a turbulent boundary layer  to manipulate individual coherent flow structures.  In particular, I propose to continue to use our CFD approach  to investigate the use of riblets to constrain the development  of local turbulent regions.  In the late stages of boundary layer transition to turbulence, turbulent spots  may form.  As a turbulent spot moves downstream, it spreads laterally  until it merges with other growing spots and the entire span becomes turbulent.  Although the spots themselves have an interesting structure,   they appear much like small arrowhead-shaped  regions of fairly developed turbulence and so should be subject   to means of control  already developed for a fully turbulent boundary layer.  Although the development of spots of turbulence may be unavoidable,  perhaps their growth can be constrained by a riblet covered surface.  So even though having riblets covering much of an aircraft surface where the bou  ndary layer is  already turbulent does not usually pay off, riblets applied locally to extend th  e end of the laminar  region have greater potential leverage since there is such   a large increase in shear stress  in a turbulent flow and since small areas of riblets are cheap.    We are directly simulating this process. The direct numerical simulations  of the Navier Stokes equations are done in a channel-like domain   that is very long  in the streamwise direction. The emphasis of the work is on studying  the fundamental nature of the flows generated during the transition process  and how such small scale textures interact with the turbulent vortex  structures in a wall-bounded flow.    We have also begun a project to model rarefied atmospheric flows on our  moon after a comet impact an on Jupiter's moon Io.

In doing so, they can have both constructive and destructive impact on their hosts. Constructively, TEs provide a wealth of new genetic material for natural selection to act upon. Destructively, TEs promote genome instability via ectopic recombination, chromosome instability, and mutation. To counter the negative impacts TEs can have on their hosts, mechanisms have evolved to suppress TE expression, including DNA methylation and establishment of repressive chromatin. Prior to repression, TEs must be recognized as non-self DNA, and very little is known about what influences host recognition aside from the machinery involved (ie: small RNAs, Krppel-associated box domain containing zinc finger proteins [KRAB-ZFPs]) and that all known recognition mechanisms are sequence-dependent. Our understanding of the host response to TE invasion is particularly poor in mammals, in part because relatively few TEs all retrotransposons- have been recently active in human and mouse, as compared to other model organisms. To better understand how mammalian hosts respond to TEs, this proposal will utilize the vespertilionid (vesper) bats, whose genomes, unlike other mammals, have undergone numerous recent waves of transposition from a wide range of TEs, including DNA transposons and Helitrons. Specifically, this proposal will determine how acquisition of host-derived sequences by TEs, which has been commonly observed in various organisms, modulates the level at which TEs are recognized and silenced. We will test two fundamental hypotheses: (i) TEs with different histories and replication strategies are silenced differentially and (ii) acquisition of host sequences confers resistance against host TE defense systems. To test this, will we determine both the repression (Aim 1: methylome, chromatin accessibility, and KAP1 mediated rpression using MeDIP/MRE-Seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq respectively) and expression (Aim 2: RNA-sequencing) level of TEs in multiple tissues from three vesper bat species and one phylostomid bat and assess how acquisition of host sequence impacts the silencing process. The proposed research will address, for the first time, how host recognition and repression responses differ between RNA and DNA transposons, as well as provide insight into a possible mechanism for how TEs might evade recognition.

However, they are limited by a lack of stellar characterization derived from high-resolution stellar spectra, thus presenting a new data analysis challenges.  Recent studies have called into question the accuracy of the standard techniques used to measure stellar parameters from these spectra, including systematic errors that may be inherent to algorithms used to do the parameter measurements. With this in mind, we have developed SME@XSEDE, a new automated technique to measure stellar parameters by coupling well tested analysis tools with the advantages of large computational resources. At the core of our methodology, we utilize existing and stable software to perform the detailed synthesis of stellar spectra (SME: Spectroscopy Made Easy). However, instead of using traditional non-linear least-squares minimization or grid search techniques to find stellar parameters, we are performing a more extensive analysis using a Monte Carlo approach. We incorporate Bayesian analysis to determine a most-probable set of stellar parameters with robust uncertainties derived from posterior probability distributions. In addition, we will employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using SME, This MCMC is based on an affine-invariant ensemble sampler, making this analysis computationally feasible through the use distributed computing resources (massively parallel processing centers). This approach will allow us to efficiently probe large amounts of parameter space, marginalize over \"nuisance parameters\", effectively apply priors (e.g., an a priori temperature determination), determine confidence intervals, and easily identify problems with parameter convergence by visually inspecting their posterior distribution functions. By applying our new technique to determine stellar parameters for several different projects, including a large survey of potential exoplanet host stars from the Kepler mission, our proposed analysis will provide valuable datasets of benchmark extrasolar systems which will lead to new insight into the nature of exoplanets in our Galaxy.\n", "pi_institution": "Harvard University"}, "TG-MCB100109": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "tg459374", "Name": "t_iabl_a001_pon_510", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-BIO150059"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6532162", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-09T05:33:17Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T13:48:16Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T13:48:16Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-09T05:33:17Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T13:48:16Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6532162.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 222512}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "tg459374", "Name": "t_auto_a001_505", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-BIO150059"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6532186", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-09T05:39:01Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T00:02:42Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T00:02:42Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-09T05:39:01Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T00:02:42Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6532186.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 1015056}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "tg459374", "Name": "yt_aabl_a001_515", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-BIO150059"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6532276", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-09T06:06:42Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T00:19:43Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T00:19:42Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-09T06:06:42Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T00:19:43Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6532276.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 998736}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "tg459374", "Name": "t_iabl_pon_480", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-BIO150059"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6554006", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-13T19:13:21Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T05:51:58Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T05:51:58Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-13T19:13:21Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T05:51:58Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6554006.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 679760}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "tg459374", "Name": "yt_aabl_adp_a001_360", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-BIO150059"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6573506", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T06:24:01Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T08:37:16Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T08:37:16Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T06:24:01Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T08:37:16Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6573506.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 521088}], "name": "TG-BIO150059", "principal_investigator": "Nadeem Vellore", "field_of_science": "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO)", "project_abstract": "Biomolecular simulation can provide unprecedented details of the structure and dynamics of the biological systems at the atomic level.

Our coarse-grained studies have brought up interesting questions that are important in order to understand the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by HA2. Here, to address these questions, we request a total of 4.7 million SUs on Stampede supercomputer, to perform explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations with a newly developed single-copy enhanced sampling method and the CHARMM36 force field. Project 1 needs 2.5 million SUs to map out the free energy landscape of the B-loop domain of HA2, which undergoes a loop-to-coiled-coil transition that presents the fusion peptides to the host membrane. There is much controversy in the field as to whether the B-loop is enthalpically-downhill driven (spring-loaded), or whether there is a significant entropic barrier to its transition. Our simulations will conclusively discern the mechanism of this transition. Project 2 needs 2.2 million SUs to address the dynamics and structure of fusion peptides once they have been introduced into the host membrane. Through simulations, we will find out whether the fusion peptides aggregrate, form a specific functional oligomer, or simply provide an anchor for HA2.

phosphorylation on protein-lipid interactions. Our protein of interest is an inwardly rectifying (Kir) potassium ion channel isolated from a marine sponge; the channel is used in comparative physiology studies because it functions similar to mammalian homologues, except in a key regulatory feature.  Unlike all vertebrate channels of this type, the sponge channel (AqKir) is not activated by the membrane lipid, phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2). We have demonstrated that single point mutations confer PIP2 dependency on the AqKir channels. How the ubiquitous PIP2 regulation of Kir potassium channels evolved and the key structural features that permit the lipid regulation are important to understand.  When completed, the project will provide insight of medical importance to drug design and of evolutionary importance to understanding the impact of structural changes on function. So far, we have generated several homology models based on crystal structures of vertebrate Kir channels  Access to the computational resources is now needed to understand how the model protein- PIP2 complex stabilizes and the effect of phosphorylation on this interaction.  Using the requested allocation, a series of 20-50 ns production runs will be conducted on each system.  We will use the NAMD package.  Per residue interaction energies will be calculated from these molecular dynamic simulations. In addition to resolving the role of identified and mutant residues, this approach may uncover contributions to channel-PIP2 interactions that are not readily identified by amino acid sequence alignments.

The algorithm transforms the genetic code into a DNA Secondary Code by partitioning into genomic alphabet of discrete size.  Libraries comprised of evolutionarily conserved genomic building blocks are constructed by simulating DNA shuffling within genomic alphabet comprising the DNA Secondary Code.   Wherein, shuffling is simulated by random hybridization of DNA sequences selected from across an orthologous sequence space constructed by an NCBI-BLAST query.  Building blocks are selected based on probability of formation derived from DNA binding states and scored for evolutional conservation utilizing algorithms presented herein.  The GEB algorithm identifies building blocks dispersed over orthologous sequence space by solving variance of candidates from a universal domain of sequences constructed utilizing a DNA shuffling based Monte Carlo simulation.  The algorithm applies directionality to variance creating sequence vectors that convey a color attribute, wherein sequences may possess (+) or (-) color attribute.  Genomic building blocks are identified by constructing a homogeneous domain of (+) colored sequences formed by passing candidates thru a theoretical filter, followed by quantile normalization using R.  Building block libraries allow GenEBiogenesis to perform random DNA shuffling based gene engineering, targeted gene engineering and De Novo engineering by writing novel genetic codes.  The GEB algorithm is tethered to NCBI-Blast as well as a collection of microbial, plant and mammalian genome databases that includes the human genome.

There is evidence that vibrationally excited molecules have very different reaction rates than predicted by conventional chemical\nkinetics models developed for gas-phase combustion. Vibrational nonequilibrium also\nleads to thermal energy transport and deposition to regions of the flow far from the source of vibrational excitation. This energy exchange could affect turbulent mixing, and hence the fundamental structure of turbulent flames. We hypothesize that these combined effects of modified chemistry and energy exchange across scales will fundamentally alter\nthe Kolmogorov turbulence cascade as well as models used for the flame structure in\nboth non-premixed and premixed systems. We further argue that creating vibrational\nnonequilibrium in a flow may provide a means to control reaction rates thereby facilitating favorable reactions or inhibiting undesirable ones.\n\nWe will explore the use of vibrational nonequilibrium as a means to control reacting gasphase systems with applications ranging from materials synthesis to scramjet combustion. The program has two main targets: 1) Understanding the laminar flame structure in diffusion flames, when one of the flow streams is vibrationally activated, and 2) understanding the impact of vibrational nonequilibrium on the turbulence energy cascade and flame propagation in turbulent flames. Current experimental and computational tools are inadequate to isolate thermal nonequilibrium effects from other interactions. We propose to use high-fidelity Raman measurements to quantify the degree of vibrational nonequilibrium.

The relatively fast turn-around time of RANS simulations enables optimizing the heat exchanger geometry, but there is considerable uncertainty in the solution of the optimization problem as a result of uncertainty in the RANS results. This uncertainty originates primarily from the use of turbulence and turbulent heat transfer models to provide closure for the Reynolds stress tensor and turbulent scalar flux vector. To enable robust optimization of the geometry, the uncertainty introduced by these models should therefore be quantified. \nDuring the PI's postdoc, a promising method to quantify turbulence model form uncertainty was developed. The method introduces realizable perturbations in the modeled quantities, i.e. the Reynolds stress tensor and turbulent heat flux vector, to determine plausible bounds on the quantity of interest.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal.

The topic of star formation histories of dwarfs has also received significant attention recently in the context of possible small-scale problems of the LCDM model: if episodic bursts of star formation inject energy into dwarfs' dark matter halos, it may provide a natural explanation of the observed low densities of dwarf galaxies within LCDM.\n\nOur simulations will adopt physically-motivated, explicit feedback prescriptions that are fixed by our knowledge of stellar evolution. We will choose halos having diverse mass assembly histories within a narrow range of mass and compare their star formation histories to  observations of nearby isolated dwarf galaxies, thereby testing fundamental aspects of galaxy formation modeling and dark matter astrophysics.", "pi_institution": "University of Texas at Austin"}, "TG-AST140015": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:development.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "makwana", "Name": "double_s", "Extension": {"Priority": 206, "LocalAccount": "TG-AST140015"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1843200, "Queue": "development", "LocalIDFromManager": "6579768", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T16:47:20Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T18:48:40Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:48:40Z", "RequestedSlots": 256, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T16:47:20Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T18:48:40Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6579768.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 790272}], "name": "TG-AST140015", "principal_investigator": "Peera Pongkitiwanichakul", "field_of_science": "Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics", "project_abstract": "We propose a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that are aimed at clarifying the mechanisms that lead to heating of stellar coronae.

The coupling between fluid and chemistry is supported in these applications by either thermo-vibrational relaxation or chemical kinetics. This project focuses on non-equilibrium thermochemical effects in free-shear instability.  The goal of the project is to improve the understanding of how chemical phenomena act to modify fluid instability, thus shedding light on the possibility to predict and control fluid-chemistry interaction in the hypersonic regime.\n\nThe interaction between fluid and chemical processes is boosted by two features: non-parallel (global instability) and parallel acoustic instability (Mack modes). In a research currently sponsored by NASA we are focusing on the global instability in hypermixers, whereby ramps and pylons are added to the classic mixing layer to increase the mixing rate. \n\nThe use of massive parallel computing in hypersonic instability and mixing is necessary to resolve the large chemical space and the complex three-dimensional modes.  On the one hand, a large chemical space in required to simulate inelastic and bound-free collisions between molecules from first principle. In L. Massa and J.M. Austin, Physics of Fluids (2008) we have developed a 128 species collisional air model that has served as the basis of our research since. On the other hand, the analysis of global modes has been a recent addition to our research activity, spurred by the NASA funding. Such a research is described in details in an upcoming publication (Massa, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 2014). The search of global modes involves the determination of the linearized flow Jacobian for complex geometries within an adaptive mesh refinement strategy. The block-adaptive mesh refinement strategy yields large discretizations necessary to resolve the thin vortical layers. Typically we use 6-7 levels meshes containing between 50 million and 100 million solution points.  Thus, the Jacobian matrices contain approximately 500 million rows. Moreover, a large number of entries (> 528) per row is used at the fine-coarse interfaces near the boundaries. Thus, the search for the global modes is memory intensive, and we have typically run simulations on 4,000 computer nodes. The search of the global modes of instability is performed with a complex shift-and-invert Arnoldi factorization implemented in PARPACK. The shift and invert operations require the solution of very large matrix systems with poor diagonal dominance due to shifting. We use the deflated GMRES algorithm implemented in PETSC with three levels of preconditioning, in order: 1) a composite multiplicative split between imaginary and real parts, 2) an additive Schwarz method to split the system in geometrical subdomains, 3) an incomplete LU factorization to precondition the geometrically split problems.

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create signi?cant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC\u2019s Stampede machine, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a signi?cant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This con?uence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this   work. \n\nTo address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi?cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. \n\nThis work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualizaiton capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that ef?ciently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs.

There is evidence that vibrationally excited molecules have very different reaction rates than predicted by conventional chemical\nkinetics models developed for gas-phase combustion. Vibrational nonequilibrium also\nleads to thermal energy transport and deposition to regions of the flow far from the source of vibrational excitation. This energy exchange could affect turbulent mixing, and hence the fundamental structure of turbulent flames. We hypothesize that these combined effects of modified chemistry and energy exchange across scales will fundamentally alter\nthe Kolmogorov turbulence cascade as well as models used for the flame structure in\nboth non-premixed and premixed systems. We further argue that creating vibrational\nnonequilibrium in a flow may provide a means to control reaction rates thereby facilitating favorable reactions or inhibiting undesirable ones.\n\nWe will explore the use of vibrational nonequilibrium as a means to control reacting gasphase systems with applications ranging from materials synthesis to scramjet combustion. The program has two main targets: 1) Understanding the laminar flame structure in diffusion flames, when one of the flow streams is vibrationally activated, and 2) understanding the impact of vibrational nonequilibrium on the turbulence energy cascade and flame propagation in turbulent flames. Current experimental and computational tools are inadequate to isolate thermal nonequilibrium effects from other interactions. We propose to use high-fidelity Raman measurements to quantify the degree of vibrational nonequilibrium. Laser diagnostic tools will be used to characterize this flame structure under varying levels of nonequilibrium. Since even these measurements only provide limited access to the flame physics, direct numerical simulations (DNS) will be used to analyze the energy cascade and vibrational energy transfer.

interactions, high-temperature gas research (e.g. chemistry, gas kinetics, and radiation modeling), hypersonics, and orbital environment simulation.  The University of Colorado Colorado Springs, in collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory, is currently working on neutral gas heating via non-resonant pulsed optical lattices formed by counter-propagating laser pulses.  This experimentation is greatly enhanced by complimentary numerical simulation.  Using the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo method for statistical gas dynamic simulation, the simulations proposed will elucidate the kinetic phenomenon at the core of the interaction between a neutral atmospheric gas and high intensity pulsed optical lattices (lasers).  Current experimental capabilities in diagnosing the underlying mechanisms are limited by the fast time-scales and small length-scales of the interaction.  Numerical simulations are not similarly limited and can give data (e.g. velocity and internal energy distributions) inaccessible to experiment.  In pairing the proposed simulations with existing experimental data, this proposal seeks to gain an inside look at the micro-scale molecular interaction (both molecule-molecule and molecule-laser) which drive the experimentally observed phenomena.  The code used for these simulations is SMILE, a thoroughly tested gas dynamic simulation package written in MPI Fortran 77 and specially modified to simulated the laser-gas interaction of interest.  This simulation tool has been used extensively for similar simulations on DoD HPC facilities, demonstrating the PIs expertise in performing the proposed work.  Two test cases were run on TACC Lonestar and TACC Ranger.  A total simulation time of 175,000 SU on the TACC Lonestar system (or 370,000 SU on Ranger) is being requested to perform the proposed simulations.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal.

Many extreme climate events affecting the US and other countries surrounding the Atlantic, such as hurricanes and severe flood and drought events, are influenced by conditions in the Atlantic Ocean. It is therefore imperative to have accurate simulations of the climatic mean and variability in the Atlantic region to be able to make credible projections of future climate change affecting the US and other countries adjoining the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, current-generation IPCC-class climate models exhibit severe biases in their simulations of tropical Atlantic climate. An infamous symptom of the Atlantic biases is the persistent warm sea-surface temperature (SST) bias of more than 6C off the coast of Namibia and Angola, which severely hampers our ability to accurately simulate and project impacts of global climate change in the region. This research focuses on improving our current understanding of causes of the biases, leading to major improvements in simulation and projection of future climate change within the Atlantic sector and beyond. \n\nIntellectual Merit. The research outlined in this proposal will significantly extend previous understanding of tropical Atlantic biases in a number of ways: 1) oceanic contributions to the biases will be assessed and sources will be identified through a combined analysis of observations, ocean reanalysis products, Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) model simulations and eddy-resolving regional ocean simulations; 2) atmospheric contributions to the biases will be evaluated by a comparative analysis of atmospheric reanalysis data and convection-resolving regional atmospheric model simulations; 3) the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in amplifying the oceanic or atmospheric biases will be examined by conducting high-resolution coupled regional climate model (CRCM) simulations. The use of high-resolution (up to 3 km) regional climate models allows explicitly resolving oceanic mesoscale eddies, fronts and upwelling dynamics off the west coast of southern Africa, as well as atmospheric convection and steep orography effects, and thus minimizes model systematic errors due to uncertainties associated with parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. This modeling approach also isolates sources of the biases from other ocean basins and helps to pinpoint the causes of the biases within the Atlantic basin. It further facilitates a better model-data comparison as recent intense observational programs within the Atlantic sector have together produced an array of fine temporal and spatial resolution data sets that require high-resolution model simulations to fully utilize their advantages. Furthermore, the proposal is timely, because it coincides with the launch of two major European research projects in the study region, i.e., the German project Southwest African Coastal Upwelling System and Benguela Nio (SACUS) led by Brandt and the EU project Enhancing prediction of tropical Atlantic climate and its impacts (PREFACE) led by Keenlyside, both of which are expected to generate new arrays of observations along the southern Africa coast. If funded, we anticipate close collaboration with the European colleagues throughout the project. Combining the new observations with the detailed modeling approach, we expect new breakthroughs in solving tropical Atlantic bias problems.\n\nBroader Impacts.  The research will enhance our understanding of the uncertainties in projecting impacts of global climate change in the Atlantic region, which has enormous socio-economic implications for countries in the region. The CRCM is being developed within the framework of the Coupler (CPL7) software that is part of the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM). This framework allows us to easily port parameterizations between CESM and the CRCM, and potentially allow partial coupling between the CESM and the CRCM.  We envision that the CRCM will become a community-modeling tool and be made available to the broader climate research community. Findings from this study on reducing climate model biases will feedback to community model development activities. The project will support one graduate student and one postdoc at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and provide valuable professional development for all young scientists, including Co-PI Patricola, involved in the program.\n", "pi_institution": "Texas A&M University"}, "TG-AST130007": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID":

Central to this project is the PIs USPEX code (including evolutionary algorithm, metadynamics method, the VC-NEB method and TPS approach), interfaced with first-principles electronic structure calculations. This approach has already given many interesting predictions confirmed by experiment. Our calculations will be performed with the widely used ab-initio VASP code. The properties of the stable and metastable structures obtained in this project will be studied and promising new functional materials will be identified. These calculations, in addition to providing practically important results, will also allow us to test the concept of hybrid global optimization, where global optimization with respect to a desired property (for example hardness) is conducted in the space of local minima of the (free) energy.

In this proposal, we request for TeraGrid computational facilities to approach cellular mechanotransduction from a computational viewpoint and shed light on two important sub-cellular phenomena in which the role of mechanical factors are decisive: focal adhesion formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Individual molecules are suggested to be molecular mechanosensors at focal adhesions. These molecules alter their binding activity upon exposure to external force. We will investigate the validity of this suggestion and evaluate the mechanisms by which single molecules at focal adhesions could act as molecular mechanosensors. \nWhile our main focus in this proposal will be investigation of focal adhesion formation, we also aim to shed light on nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) using two different approaches: (1) all atomic simulations and (2) coarse-grained modeling. It is suggested that NPC tpr proteins interact with transport factors crm1 and importin-&#946;/&#945; to facilitate the cargo-complex translocation across the NPC. The alleged hydrophobic binding sites, however, are not determined yet. We suggest a thorough molecular dynamic simulation to find those sites. Results from this project could reveal possible mechanisms for facilitated transport. Taking into account the results of all-atomic simulations, we also will develop a coarse-grained model of the whole structure of the NPC to provide a big picture of nucleocytoplasmic transport and find out the specific role of some important factors in active transport, such as FG-repeat density in the pore, active cargo-FG hydrophobic binding affinity, aspect ratio of active cargo, and existing of competing factors within the pore for FG-repeat binding sites.

I the case of epitaxy, high performance computing will help address the long-standing controversy on the role played by kinetic and thermodynamics effects in the formation of mounds and quantum dots, which are three dimensional structures that can be exploited for many exciting new applications such as high-efficiency lasers or nonvolatile storage. In the case of cardiac arrhythmia, high performance computing will help design control strategies for terminating spiral wave activity associated with cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nHigh performance computing is needed in both cases: in the case of Epitaxial growth, HPC is needed because of the combination of the large size of the computational domains necessary in the study of step-edge dynamics and the resolution needed to capture fine scale details. HPC is needed in the case of the study of Cardiac Arrhythmias because the number of independent variables constitute a space in high dimensions (4, 5, 6, ...).

The objective of this research is to develop a computational framework that addresses interesting and important multiphase flow problems, such as boiling flows, cavitating flows, etc. We have gained an initial success in simulating boiling flows, and the result can be previewed in ICES research album https://www.flickr.com/photos/icesut/14992969345/ We believe this is time to perform deeper investigations in this direction and the methodology will have significant impacts on physics and engineering.", "pi_institution": "Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics"}, "TG-MCB110140": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "cjhsieh", "Name": "dsmlr,1,rep5", "Extension": {"Priority": 1193, "LocalAccount": "NetworkMining"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 11059200, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6573681", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T08:11:06Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T14:37:07Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-17T14:37:07Z", "RequestedSlots": 64, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T08:11:06Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T14:37:07Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6573681.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 6232128}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "cjhsieh", "Name": "dsmlr,1,rep5", "Extension": {"Priority": 1193, "LocalAccount": "NetworkMining"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 11059200, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6573682", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T08:11:32Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T14:37:07Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-17T14:37:07Z", "RequestedSlots": 64, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T08:11:32Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T14:37:07Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6573682.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 6232128}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "cjhsieh", "Name": "dsmlr,1,rep5", "Extension": {"Priority": 1191, "LocalAccount": "NetworkMining"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 11059200, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6573680", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T08:10:51Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T14:33:09Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-17T14:33:09Z", "RequestedSlots": 64, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T08:10:51Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T14:33:09Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6573680.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 6247360}], "name": "NetworkMining", "principal_investigator": "Inderjit Dhillon", "field_of_science": "Information, Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRI)", "project_abstract": "The proposed research will apply data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze large-scale networks that arise in varied scientific applications.

Traditionally simulations and predictions beyond the NWP range for tropical Atlantic storms have largely been on their frequency of occurrence throughout the basin over the 6-month period from June through November. This type of forecast or simulation has limited application although they have demonstrated admirable skill on seasonal time scales and on longer time scales in their rendition of the 20th century variability. The success of this study could be a harbinger for attempting predictions of a subset of the tropical Atlantic storms that are geographically more limited in the basin (western Atlantic). Furthermore a majority of TWAS make landfall over continental North America. In addition, the TWAS climatologically has a characteristic dominance of genesis in June and November, which could also be potentially exploited if we understand their causality. Thus this proposal is relevant to NOAAs NGSP mission on climate adaptation and mitigation to the threat of potential land falling tropical storms in North America.\n\tThe proposed work will employ high-resolution (~10km) coupled ocean-atmosphere model centered over the IAS in an attempt to resolve the TWAS, the Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ), air-sea fluxes in the IAS, the diurnal variations in the region and capture the associated, intricate sub-surface ocean structure. In addition several sensitivity experiments are also proposed to understand the influence on the genesis and lifecycle of TWAS. This framework of regional coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling is deliberately chosen to afford the high resolution for multi-decadal integrations and limit the model drift by forcing the regional system with credible large-scale reanalysis (NCEP CFSR). The coupled GCMs have shown acute climatological bias in the IAS region with poor depiction of the associated variability in the boreal summer season.\n\tThe central objective of the proposal is to understand whether (and followed by how) IAS climate processes like the evolution of the IAS SST and sub-surface ocean evolution from the prior seasons, variability of CLLJ, air-sea fluxes in IAS, overlying atmospheric meridional cell can influence TWAS. The basis for this investigation is buttressed by several related observational evidence, a clear working knowledge of the models to be employed with its demonstration of use over another domain, and availability of computing resources to conduct the proposed integrations.\n", "pi_institution": "Florida State University"}, "Hydrologic-Data-Assi": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:development.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "snoh", "Name": "idv29748", "Extension": {"Priority": 1460, "LocalAccount": "Hydrologic-Data-Assi"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 14400, "Queue": "development", "LocalIDFromManager": "6580015", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T17:33:48Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T17:48:56Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T17:33:56Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T17:33:48Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T17:48:56Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6580015.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 5952}], "name": "Hydrologic-Data-Assi", "principal_investigator": "Dong-Jun Seo", "field_of_science": "Cross-Directorate Activities", "project_abstract": "One of the most important predictands derived from weather and climate models is streamflow, on which the Nation\u2019s public safety, economic development and water security critically depend.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal.

It has been developed in our research group and it is\r\nnow a robust and user-friendly code, whose performance is comparable\r\nto the fastest codes used in the DFT community. Our group has\r\npioneered DFT calculations of semiconductor clusters with several\r\nnanometers in size. In the last few months, we reported\r\nfirst-principles calculations of silicon clusters with 10,000 atoms,\r\nten times more than the then existing size limit. Our group has done\r\nseminal contributions to the development of a real-space approach for\r\npseudopotentials using DFT, and we applied it successfully to a\r\nvariety of different systems ranging from crystalline materials to\r\nliquids, surfaces, clusters, and isolated molecules. Employing a\r\nreal-space approach is the natural choice for the study of\r\nnanostructures since it avoids many complications inherent to\r\nalternative methods, mostly because it does not use an explicit basis\r\nin the expansion of electronic states. Also, there are few convergence\r\nparameters, and the computer codes can be parallelized in a\r\nstraightforward and efficient way by just partitioning the volume of\r\ninterest among processors. Some of the subprojects we are executing\r\nnow are: electronic transport and spin transport through a metal-metal\r\njunction; evolution of the magnetization as function of number of\r\natoms in iron clusters; structural and chemical stability of ternary clusters based on the Heusler phases; optical properties of passivated semiconductor\r\nclusters and nanowires; vibrational modes of molecules in electronic\r\nexcited states; doping of semiconductor clusters with magnetic atoms; size effects in multiferroic materials.", "pi_institution": "Institute for Computational Engineering and Science"}, "BattPFM_PROD": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kbyahya", "Name": "CB05poa", "Extension": {"Priority": 1332, "LocalAccount": "TG-ATM130003"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 13824000, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6575528", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T18:18:46Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T20:15:44Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T05:15:44Z", "RequestedSlots": 256, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T18:18:46Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T20:15:44Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6575528.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 11433216}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kbyahya", "Name": "cb6frag", "Extension": {"Priority": 1263, "LocalAccount": "TG-ATM130003"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 22118400, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6575703", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T18:52:42Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T03:31:49Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T03:31:49Z", "RequestedSlots": 256, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T18:52:42Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T03:31:49Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6575703.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 13029376}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kbyahya", "Name": "CB05frg", "Extension": {"Priority": 1248, "LocalAccount": "TG-ATM130003"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 16588800, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6575681", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T18:47:30Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T20:58:54Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T02:58:54Z", "RequestedSlots": 256, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T18:47:30Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T20:58:54Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6575681.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 13534976}], "name": "TG-ATM130003", "principal_investigator": "Yang Zhang", "field_of_science": "Atmospheric Sciences (ATM)", "project_abstract": "In response to the emerging research needs identified by National Research Council and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with support from NSF, we are developing an Integrated Technology-Driven Earth System Model (ITDEaSM) to link technology options, energy use, and policy choices and resultant emissions with Earth system processes that govern climate change, air quality, water quality, and ecosystem.  ITDEaSM will be developed by coupling and adding capability to a suite of community models to address grand challenges in decadal regional climate predictions and fill in major gaps in existing climate, Earth system, and ecosystem modeling.

Vibrational nonequilibrium also\nleads to thermal energy transport and deposition to regions of the flow far from the source of vibrational excitation.

We hypothesize that these combined effects of modified chemistry and energy exchange across scales will fundamentally alter\nthe Kolmogorov turbulence cascade as well as models used for the flame structure in\nboth non-premixed and premixed systems.

Many extreme climate events affecting the US and other countries surrounding the Atlantic, such as hurricanes and severe flood and drought events, are influenced by conditions in the Atlantic Ocean. It is therefore imperative to have accurate simulations of the climatic mean and variability in the Atlantic region to be able to make credible projections of future climate change affecting the US and other countries adjoining the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, current-generation IPCC-class climate models exhibit severe biases in their simulations of tropical Atlantic climate. An infamous symptom of the Atlantic biases is the persistent warm sea-surface temperature (SST) bias of more than 6C off the coast of Namibia and Angola, which severely hampers our ability to accurately simulate and project impacts of global climate change in the region. This research focuses on improving our current understanding of causes of the biases, leading to major improvements in simulation and projection of future climate change within the Atlantic sector and beyond. \n\nIntellectual Merit. The research outlined in this proposal will significantly extend previous understanding of tropical Atlantic biases in a number of ways: 1) oceanic contributions to the biases will be assessed and sources will be identified through a combined analysis of observations, ocean reanalysis products, Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) model simulations and eddy-resolving regional ocean simulations; 2) atmospheric contributions to the biases will be evaluated by a comparative analysis of atmospheric reanalysis data and convection-resolving regional atmospheric model simulations; 3) the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in amplifying the oceanic or atmospheric biases will be examined by conducting high-resolution coupled regional climate model (CRCM) simulations. The use of high-resolution (up to 3 km) regional climate models allows explicitly resolving oceanic mesoscale eddies, fronts and upwelling dynamics off the west coast of southern Africa, as well as atmospheric convection and steep orography effects, and thus minimizes model systematic errors due to uncertainties associated with parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. This modeling approach also isolates sources of the biases from other ocean basins and helps to pinpoint the causes of the biases within the Atlantic basin. It further facilitates a better model-data comparison as recent intense observational programs within the Atlantic sector have together produced an array of fine temporal and spatial resolution data sets that require high-resolution model simulations to fully utilize their advantages. Furthermore, the proposal is timely, because it coincides with the launch of two major European research projects in the study region, i.e., the German project Southwest African Coastal Upwelling System and Benguela Nio (SACUS) led by Brandt and the EU project Enhancing prediction of tropical Atlantic climate and its impacts (PREFACE) led by Keenlyside, both of which are expected to generate new arrays of observations along the southern Africa coast. If funded, we anticipate close collaboration with the European colleagues throughout the project. Combining the new observations with the detailed modeling approach, we expect new breakthroughs in solving tropical Atlantic bias problems.\n\nBroader Impacts.  The research will enhance our understanding of the uncertainties in projecting impacts of global climate change in the Atlantic region, which has enormous socio-economic implications for countries in the region. The CRCM is being developed within the framework of the Coupler (CPL7) software that is part of the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM). This framework allows us to easily port parameterizations between CESM and the CRCM, and potentially allow partial coupling between the CESM and the CRCM.  We envision that the CRCM will become a community-modeling tool and be made available to the broader climate research community. Findings from this study on reducing climate model biases will feedback to community model development activities. The project will support one graduate student and one postdoc at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and provide valuable professional development for all young scientists, including Co-PI Patricola, involved in the program.\n", "pi_institution": "Texas A&M University"}, "TG-DMR120071": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:largemem.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "janotti", "Name": "job", "Extension": {"Priority": 297, "LocalAccount": "TG-DMR150099"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 5529600, "Queue": "largemem", "LocalIDFromManager": "6569054", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-16T14:44:55Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T21:22:18Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-16T21:22:18Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-16T14:44:55Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T21:22:18Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6569054.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 5102912}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:largemem.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "janotti", "Name": "job", "Extension": {"Priority": 247, "LocalAccount": "TG-DMR150099"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 5529600, "Queue": "largemem", "LocalIDFromManager": "6569730", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-16T16:51:06Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T21:46:28Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-16T21:46:28Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-16T16:51:06Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T21:46:28Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6569730.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 5056512}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:largemem.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "janotti", "Name": "job", "Extension": {"Priority": 186, "LocalAccount": "TG-DMR150099"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 5529600, "Queue": "largemem", "LocalIDFromManager": "6570397", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-16T18:52:46Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T21:46:28Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-16T21:46:28Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-16T18:52:46Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T21:46:28Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6570397.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 5056512}], "name": "TG-DMR150099", "principal_investigator": "Anderson Janotti", "field_of_science": "Materials Research (DMR)", "project_abstract": "This is a new proposal for an XSEDE research allocation, which will support the research on\ncomputational modeling of advanced materials in the group of Prof. Anderson Janotti in the\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Delaware (UD).

The coupling between fluid and chemistry is supported in these applications by either thermo-vibrational relaxation or chemical kinetics. This project focuses on non-equilibrium thermochemical effects in free-shear instability.  The goal of the project is to improve the understanding of how chemical phenomena act to modify fluid instability, thus shedding light on the possibility to predict and control fluid-chemistry interaction in the hypersonic regime.\n\nThe interaction between fluid and chemical processes is boosted by two features: non-parallel (global instability) and parallel acoustic instability (Mack modes). In a research currently sponsored by NASA we are focusing on the global instability in hypermixers, whereby ramps and pylons are added to the classic mixing layer to increase the mixing rate. \n\nThe use of massive parallel computing in hypersonic instability and mixing is necessary to resolve the large chemical space and the complex three-dimensional modes.  On the one hand, a large chemical space in required to simulate inelastic and bound-free collisions between molecules from first principle. In L. Massa and J.M. Austin, Physics of Fluids (2008) we have developed a 128 species collisional air model that has served as the basis of our research since. On the other hand, the analysis of global modes has been a recent addition to our research activity, spurred by the NASA funding. Such a research is described in details in an upcoming publication (Massa, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 2014). The search of global modes involves the determination of the linearized flow Jacobian for complex geometries within an adaptive mesh refinement strategy. The block-adaptive mesh refinement strategy yields large discretizations necessary to resolve the thin vortical layers. Typically we use 6-7 levels meshes containing between 50 million and 100 million solution points.  Thus, the Jacobian matrices contain approximately 500 million rows. Moreover, a large number of entries (> 528) per row is used at the fine-coarse interfaces near the boundaries. Thus, the search for the global modes is memory intensive, and we have typically run simulations on 4,000 computer nodes. The search of the global modes of instability is performed with a complex shift-and-invert Arnoldi factorization implemented in PARPACK. The shift and invert operations require the solution of very large matrix systems with poor diagonal dominance due to shifting. We use the deflated GMRES algorithm implemented in PETSC with three levels of preconditioning, in order: 1) a composite multiplicative split between imaginary and real parts, 2) an additive Schwarz method to split the system in geometrical subdomains, 3) an incomplete LU factorization to precondition the geometrically split problems.

Vasquez", "field_of_science": "Genetics and Nucleic Acids", "project_abstract": "Homopolymeric stretches of deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine nucleotides, called A/G-tracts, are ubiquitous DNA elements in regulatory regions of many organisms. The molecular structure of these DNA tracts is unusual and distinct from that of canonical B-DNA, and we postulate that the biological importance of A/G-tracts resides in part in their distinct structural properties. Indeed, our current bioinformatics analyses indicate that both mutation frequencies and mutation spectra in the genome of human individuals (from the 1000Genomes Project) vary depending on the length of the tracts, the relative position of the A.T and G.C base pairs within the tracts themselves and the nature of nearest flanking base-pairs. In this project, we aim to combine bioinformatics and molecular dynamics methods to study the structural and dynamic properties of A/G-tracts, and in particular the role of first shell of hydration near the DNA molecules. The spine of hydration in A-tracts exist in crystal structures, and has been shown to play an important role in allowing DNA to distort to accommodate the highly bent structure needed to form nucleosomes. Thus, some of our current bioinformatics data may be interpreted in terms of sequence-dependent flexibility and solvation behavior in A-tracts. We plan to conduct molecular dynamics simulations of G-tracts of different lengths and to study the effect of the flanking base pair on both the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 sides, so as to connect the genomic information with the unusual properties of A/G-tracts.

Many extreme climate events affecting the US and other countries surrounding the Atlantic, such as hurricanes and severe flood and drought events, are influenced by conditions in the Atlantic Ocean. It is therefore imperative to have accurate simulations of the climatic mean and variability in the Atlantic region to be able to make credible projections of future climate change affecting the US and other countries adjoining the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, current-generation IPCC-class climate models exhibit severe biases in their simulations of tropical Atlantic climate. An infamous symptom of the Atlantic biases is the persistent warm sea-surface temperature (SST) bias of more than 6C off the coast of Namibia and Angola, which severely hampers our ability to accurately simulate and project impacts of global climate change in the region. This research focuses on improving our current understanding of causes of the biases, leading to major improvements in simulation and projection of future climate change within the Atlantic sector and beyond. \n\nIntellectual Merit. The research outlined in this proposal will significantly extend previous understanding of tropical Atlantic biases in a number of ways: 1) oceanic contributions to the biases will be assessed and sources will be identified through a combined analysis of observations, ocean reanalysis products, Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) model simulations and eddy-resolving regional ocean simulations; 2) atmospheric contributions to the biases will be evaluated by a comparative analysis of atmospheric reanalysis data and convection-resolving regional atmospheric model simulations; 3) the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in amplifying the oceanic or atmospheric biases will be examined by conducting high-resolution coupled regional climate model (CRCM) simulations. The use of high-resolution (up to 3 km) regional climate models allows explicitly resolving oceanic mesoscale eddies, fronts and upwelling dynamics off the west coast of southern Africa, as well as atmospheric convection and steep orography effects, and thus minimizes model systematic errors due to uncertainties associated with parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. This modeling approach also isolates sources of the biases from other ocean basins and helps to pinpoint the causes of the biases within the Atlantic basin. It further facilitates a better model-data comparison as recent intense observational programs within the Atlantic sector have together produced an array of fine temporal and spatial resolution data sets that require high-resolution model simulations to fully utilize their advantages. Furthermore, the proposal is timely, because it coincides with the launch of two major European research projects in the study region, i.e., the German project Southwest African Coastal Upwelling System and Benguela Nio (SACUS) led by Brandt and the EU project Enhancing prediction of tropical Atlantic climate and its impacts (PREFACE) led by Keenlyside, both of which are expected to generate new arrays of observations along the southern Africa coast. If funded, we anticipate close collaboration with the European colleagues throughout the project. Combining the new observations with the detailed modeling approach, we expect new breakthroughs in solving tropical Atlantic bias problems.\n\nBroader Impacts.  The research will enhance our understanding of the uncertainties in projecting impacts of global climate change in the Atlantic region, which has enormous socio-economic implications for countries in the region. The CRCM is being developed within the framework of the Coupler (CPL7) software that is part of the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM). This framework allows us to easily port parameterizations between CESM and the CRCM, and potentially allow partial coupling between the CESM and the CRCM.  We envision that the CRCM will become a community-modeling tool and be made available to the broader climate research community. Findings from this study on reducing climate model biases will feedback to community model development activities. The project will support one graduate student and one postdoc at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and provide valuable professional development for all young scientists, including Co-PI Patricola, involved in the program.\n", "pi_institution": "Texas A&M University"}, "TG-CHE110065": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "qshao", "Name": "gly20-angle", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-CHE110065"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6579496", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T15:40:11Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T15:40:14Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T15:40:14Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T15:40:11Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T15:40:14Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6579496.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 115088}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:gpu.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "qshao", "Name": "gly05-angle", "Extension": {"Priority": 100, "LocalAccount": "TG-CHE110065"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1382400, "Queue": "gpu", "LocalIDFromManager": "6579501", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T15:42:04Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T15:42:14Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T15:42:14Z", "RequestedSlots": 16, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T15:42:04Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T15:42:14Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6579501.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 113168}], "name": "TG-CHE110065", "principal_investigator": "Carol Hall", "field_of_science": "Physical Chemistry", "project_abstract": "We apply for an account on TeraGrid to access PSC/Pople, NICS/Kraken and TACC/Ranger for the purpose of developing and testing a strategy based on computational simulation to design a peptide sequence that could serve as a drug which interferes with the replication of HIV.

As part of this project, Oregon State University is testing new methodologies for variational data assimilation in a high resolution coastal ocean forecast model along Oregon and Washington coasts. New methodologies for data assimilation will be transitioned to the real-time coastal ocean forecast system that currently provides everyday updates of 3 day forecasts of ocean conditions, in support of environmental hazard response, search and rescue, fisheries etc. (http://ingria.coas.oregonstate.edu/rtdav/). In addition, as part of the same project, OSU has been involved in development of a similar forecast system for the entire West Coast. Currently research with the OR-WA is focused on development of a hybrid variational-ensemble assimilation system, in which the model error covariance is computed using an ensemble of model forecasts. Given this covariance, the variational method requires repeated application of the tangent linear and adjoint model components. In order to demonstrate that the new approach yields improvement in ocean state estimates, hindcast simulations are needed for a model period of at least several months. The system has been developed and initially tested using our local resources, namely a cluster of two 64 CPU shared memory nodes, connected by an InfiniBand switch (this system was purchased and assembled about 1 year ago). The ensemble in this hindcast consists of 60 members and model results for each of these members are calculated using a parallel version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS, www.myroms.org). Initial results (over a 40 day interval) suggest improvement in subsurface fields as result of assimilation of surface fields. For conclusive results, a longer run is needed. With our current resources, running the hindcast for a 6-month model period is expected to take 100 days, which is prohibitively long (esp. thinking that we will need to re-run the system repeatedly in sensitivity studies). Therefore we would like to investigate the possibility to run the hindcast on an XSEDE system. The startup allocation is requested to run the hindcast model for two six day periods plus a trial run.

The first detection of gravitational waves will push open a new window on the universe, comparable to the revolutions brought about by the development of radio, infrared, and high-energy (UV/X/$\\gamma$-ray) astronomy. Prime candidates for first detection are catastrophic events involving compact relativistic objects and their strongly nonlinear gravitational fields, in particular the coalescence of compact binaries and stellar collapse.\n\nThe challenge to meet the tremendous sensitivity requirements of gravitational wave detectors is paralleled by a computational modeling challenge: The detection, identification, and accurate determination of the physical parameters of sources relies on the detailed theoretical understanding of the source physics, and, in many cases, on the availability of waveform template banks, which are used to filter the detector signals. \n\nFor coalescing compact binaries, good analytical approximations for the gravitational waveforms are provided by post-Newtonian expansion techniques as long as the orbits are wide. For the last obits and merger, where the fields are particularly strong, and where one has the best chances of discovering entirely new physics, the full Einstein equations have to be solved numerically on supercomputers. The latter is true also and in particular for stellar collapse to a protoneutron star and the subsequent evolution to a core-collapse supernova or to stellar-mass black hole formation and a potential late-time gamma-ray burst. In this case, gravitational wave data can be complemented by information carried by neutrinos and electromagnetic waves.\n\nOur group of researchers has been involved at the heart of the recent progress in numerical relativity that is now allowing for robust simulations of compact binary coalescence, merger, and post-merger evolution as well as simulations of stellar collapse and core-collapse supernova evolution in full general relativity.\n \nHere we propose to carry out computational relativistic astrophysics modeling of stellar collapse and binary black hole coalescence, following novel research directions, employing new technical approaches while fundamentally relying on the community infrastructure Cactus that we helped create.\n\nOver the last few years, we have invested much work into black hole binary simulations and pioneered many of the techniques that render possible large scale parameter studies of these systems, and to construct from such simulations analytical template banks that describe the inspiral, merger and ringdown of black hole binaries. The binary black hole part of this project will make it possible to combine all these techniques and leap-frog black hole parameter studies in time for establishing data analysis strategies for the advanced generation of GW detectors that is expected to come online in 2014.\n\nWe have equally been at the forefront in the modeling of the general relativistic collapse of massive stars to neutron stars and in simulations of core-collapse supernovae and the accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs. In addition, we have recently developed and published much improved treatments and implementations for highly-relevant neutrino processes and the microphysical finite-temperature nuclear equation of state. The 3D stellar collapse projects that we propose here focus on the formation of black holes in failing core-collapse supernovae and on comparing 2D (axisymmetric) and 3D core-collapse supernova dynamics. The former is aimed at understanding the formation of gamma-ray burst central engines while the latter will help ascertain the influence of multi-D phenomena on the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE.

Using the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo method for statistical gas dynamic simulation, the simulations proposed will elucidate the kinetic phenomenon at the core of the interaction between a neutral atmospheric gas and high intensity pulsed optical lattices (lasers).

The unique electronic structure of graphene gives rise to many outstanding features and broad potential applications. However, the lack of a finite band gap is a big obstacle for the application of graphene on practical microelectronic devices because the intrinsic-graphene-based transistor cannot be switched off by the controlling voltage. Therefore, how to generate a finite band gap and, moreover, how to control the band gap are urgent and important research tasks.\n\nExperimental and theoretical studies have shown a few approaches to modify the electronic structure and band gap of graphene and bilayer graphene. We will focus on two of them; one is the chemical adsorption of molecules onto the graphene sheet; the other one is applying electric field to induce a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. For the first research topic, we plan to carry out first-principles studies to reveal how the molecules are adsorbed by graphene at the quantum-mechanics level and discover what kind of patterns these molecules prefer to form. For the second research topic, we will perform the first-principles calculation to study how the applied electric field induces a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. Many-electron effects will be included for the first time. Through this study we expect to explain the discrepancy between the prior theoretical calculations and experimental measurements and explore how important many-electron effects are in the electronic structure of two-dimensional semimetals. Finally, the change of the electronic structure induced by above methods will definitely have impact on the optical response of graphene and bilayer graphene. We plan to study optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene under an applied electric field with many-electron effects included. Through this study, we hope to understand how electron-hole interactions modify the infrared optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene with a finite band gap.\n\nIn order to realize above research plans, a powerful and efficient parallelized computing platform is of importance. Therefore, we write this proposal to TeraGrid for necessary computing allocation. We believe that these proposed plans will not only improve our understanding of the electronic structure and optical response of graphene but also significantly contribute to practical applications of this novel material.

These dense suspensions behave like complex fluids and have interesting flow properties. They are shear thinning, have a yield stress, show normal stresses, aging and memory and also exhibit slip at smooth shearing surfaces. We are presently developing a computational methodology to study the rheology of SPPs.\r\n\r\nIn our study, we model SPPs as a concentrated suspension of elastic spheres. The particles are packed against one another and interact through strong elastohydrodynamic lubrication forces generated due to compression and relative motion between them.

TH functions as a dimeric complex in which each monomer is composed of three domains: NADH binding (dI), NADP+ binding (dIII) and transmembrane (dII) domains. The only structure of its entire complex was modeled from a 6.9 X-ray diffraction [1], indicating that dIII domain of one monomer adopts an orientation (face-up) that is 180 flipped (face-down) with respect to the dIII of the other half of the dimer. The face-up configuration brings the NADH and NADP+ together such that hydride transfer can occur.  The face-down configuration brings the NADP+ in contact with the membrane domain where it can couple to proton translocation and the proton motive force.  It seems likely that each dIII alternates its orientation during the catalytic cycle, though this needs to be demonstrated. \n\nWe plan to perform MD simulations to explore conformational changes in this enzyme. During this startup phase, we will start with the structure of the entire dimeric enzyme with one dIII in the face-up configuration and see if the second dIII domain will assume a face-down configuration, in which dIII is bound to the membrane domain, dII. We will employ all-atom MD simulations including the entire protein (1,800 amino acids), membrane lipids and water, comprising of 240,000 atoms total, and perform an initial 50-ns equilibrium simulation. Because of the system size, the simulations require running in parallel in an estimate of 150-200 CPU cores with NAMD2, a highly optimized and publicly available MD program. Meanwhile, we plan to generate intermediates between dIII face-up and face-down orientations for the second dIII domain using non-equilibrium MD simulations (i.e. targeted MD simulation), and perhaps perform initial equilibrium simulations on each intermediate, which will also allow us to re-calibrate scalability of our approaches in the XSEDE platforms. The simulation results will be used in our multi-scale simulations to characterize transitions, the stability of the dIII orientations as well as interdomain interactions for our XSEDE research proposal, which we will submit in the next grant cycle (April 15th, 2015). Atomic and dynamic details provided by MD simulations will enhance the design of spectroscopic experiments, such as single-molecule FRET and DEER (EPR) which can directly measure distance distributions between selected residues in TH.\n\n[1] Leung JH, Schurig-Briccio LA, Yamaguchi M, Moeller A, Spier JA, Gennis RB, Stout CD.

The planned computations involve extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of STARD4-membrane systems and are required to achieve specific aims of the NIH grant R37 DK27083, PI Frederick Maxfield, Department of Biochemistry, Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). \nThe physiological role of the soluble protein domain STARD4 is to transfer sterol molecules between membranes of different cellular organelles. The proposal seeks to determine the mechanistic role that different types of inositol lipids in the membrane have in functional mechanism of STARD4. Studies in the PIs lab have established that in order to accomplish the transfer function, the STARD4 protein is selectively targeted to membrane domains enriched in anionic lipids by a region rich in basic residues. An intriguing observation is the differential regulation of STARD4 activity by two different but closely related lipid components of the membrane, PIP(4,5)2 and PIP(3,5)2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and 3,5-bisphosphate, respectively). The difference is all the more remarkable as these two physiologically important lipid components carry the same highly negative net charge. Preliminary computations performed by the co-PI, George Khelashvili (Department of Physiology and Biophysics, WCMC), have already identified specific locations on the STARD4 protein that are engaged in strong electrostatic interactions with PIP(4,5)2 lipids, and showed how mutations in STARD4 found in our experiments to inhibit function, can modulate these interactions. To accomplish the Specific Aims of the NIH grant supporting this work we have designed collaboratively a series of computational experiments building on these preliminary mechanistic studies, that require the large-scale MD simulations described in this allocation request.The computational work will be carried out in the Khelashvili lab following the collaborative protocols we have established, integrated with the cognate experiments. The protocols we have designed will i) investigate how the interactions with the various lipid components position the STARD4 domain at the membrane and prepare it for sterol binding/release events; and ii) establish a rigorous structural and dynamic context for the experimentally observed differential regulation of STARD4 activity by different inositol lipid types, and how various mutations affect such regulation.

This set of molecules also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many kinds of disease, such as autoimmune disease, lymphoma, and leukemia. Thus, analysis of an individual's repertoire of such molecules is applied in a wide variety of basic research, research and development, and clinical contexts. Despite the importance and complexity of repertoire analysis, there is currently no suite of software tools for analysis of repertoire data. Tools exist for only a subset of analysis tasks, and those that do exist were developed for use on a single project by a single research group. These tools do not function together and cannot be utilized in new studies without modification that requires  bioinformatics expertise, leaving researchers to perform repetitive and error-prone tasks by hand, to develop internal, idiosyncratic algorithms not easily generalizable or systematically applied, and to expend significant manual labor reformatting primary and derived data for passing between tools. This approach is not only error-prone and time- and labor-intensive, but it comes at the expense of reproducibility, both within and between research groups. We propose to address this critical barrier to progress by developing RepServer, a suite of interoperable repertoire analysis tools and an interface that allows users to upload a set of repertoire sequences and pass them through a seamless workflow that executes all steps in the analysis and generates an analysis report complete with data summary\ntables, statistical analyses, figures, and workflow logs. The impact of RepServer will be significant. RepServer will improve the efficiency of repertoire analysis by reducing duplication of effort and eliminating the need for significant manual manipulation of data. The latter will in turn improve the accuracy and reliability of analyses by reducing errors. RepServer will make sophisticated computational analyses of repertoires accessible to bench biologists and clinicians.

The algorithm applies directionality to variance creating sequence vectors that convey a color attribute, wherein sequences may possess (+) or (-) color attribute.  Genomic building blocks are identified by constructing a homogeneous domain of (+) colored sequences formed by passing candidates thru a theoretical filter, followed by quantile normalization using R.  Building block libraries allow GenEBiogenesis to perform random DNA shuffling based gene engineering, targeted gene engineering and De Novo engineering by writing novel genetic codes.  The GEB algorithm is tethered to NCBI-Blast as well as a collection of microbial, plant and mammalian genome databases that includes the human genome. The aforementioned allow GenEBiogenesis to perform random and targeted mutation within genes, introns, exons and intergenic regions.  The GenEBiogensis environment further allows 3D visualization of protein and DNA structures as the platform contains I-TASSER and MFOLD wrapped within the GenEBiogenesis python shell.  Notably, GenEBiogenesis offers a powerful and innovative genetic engineering tool for both evolutionally stable and intelligent gene design.", "pi_institution": "Prairie View A&M University"}, "TG-ASC150002": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:development.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "makwana", "Name": "double_s", "Extension": {"Priority": 206, "LocalAccount": "TG-AST140015"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 1843200, "Queue": "development", "LocalIDFromManager": "6579768", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T16:47:20Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T18:48:40Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:48:40Z", "RequestedSlots": 256, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T16:47:20Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T18:48:40Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6579768.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 790272}], "name": "TG-AST140015", "principal_investigator": "Peera Pongkitiwanichakul", "field_of_science": "Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics", "project_abstract": "We propose a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that are aimed at clarifying the mechanisms that lead to heating of stellar coronae.

Our protein of interest is an inwardly rectifying (Kir) potassium ion channel isolated from a marine sponge; the channel is used in comparative physiology studies because it functions similar to mammalian homologues, except in a key regulatory feature.  Unlike all vertebrate channels of this type, the sponge channel (AqKir) is not activated by the membrane lipid, phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2). We have demonstrated that single point mutations confer PIP2 dependency on the AqKir channels. How the ubiquitous PIP2 regulation of Kir potassium channels evolved and the key structural features that permit the lipid regulation are important to understand.  When completed, the project will provide insight of medical importance to drug design and of evolutionary importance to understanding the impact of structural changes on function. So far, we have generated several homology models based on crystal structures of vertebrate Kir channels  Access to the computational resources is now needed to understand how the model protein- PIP2 complex stabilizes and the effect of phosphorylation on this interaction.  Using the requested allocation, a series of 20-50 ns production runs will be conducted on each system.  We will use the NAMD package.  Per residue interaction energies will be calculated from these molecular dynamic simulations.

In these simulations, the ISM will be explicitly resolved into diffuse and dense molecular cloud phases, with stars forming only in high-density bound cores, while both gravitational capture and accretion into the sub-pc scales of the viscous accretion disk by the BH will be explicitly resolved. When stars form, or mass is accreted onto the BH, energy and momentum is injected into the surrounding media via stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) 'feedback.' We self-consistently incorporate the effects of radiation pressure (from stars and the AGN accretion disk), stellar and accretion disk winds, supernovae types I and II, and photo-ionization as well as Compton heating (by stars and AGN). This generates explosive galactic outflows and drives turbulence within both dense and diffuse gas in galaxies. \n\nWe will use these simulations to for the first time study accretion and feedback from AGN while simultaneously treating the ISM on galactic scales in a realistic fashion, without ad-hoc prescriptions which have been used in previous simulations. In this study, our proposed simulations focus on a range of scales, from small-scale simulations of the obscuring 'torus' region which can resolve inflow into scales of the viscous BH accretion disk, up through fully galaxy-scale simulations. This will allow us to simulate a range of different processes and develop an understanding of how small-scale physics of AGN accretion and driving of accretion-disk winds impacts galactic star formation and evolution. \n\nBecause of their unique realism and range of physics incorporated, the proposed simulations will be used to address a wide range of current open scientific questions. We will study the evolution of BH accretion rates, generation of nuclear and galactic-scale winds, the interaction of AGN-driven and stellar-driven galactic outflows, the effects of AGN feedback on galactic star formation, and the nature of BH-host galaxy correlations.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal. We gained experience working on Ranger via a start-up application that was granted to our group. \n", "pi_institution": "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"}, "TG-PHY160003": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "jinqing", "Name": "epoch2d3", "Extension": {"Priority": 1369, "LocalAccount": "TG-PHY160003"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 74304000, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6573450", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T06:04:01Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T13:08:46Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-17T18:08:44Z", "RequestedSlots": 480, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T06:04:01Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T13:08:46Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6573450.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 40646400}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "jinqing", "Name": "epoch2d1", "Extension": {"Priority": 1368, "LocalAccount": "TG-PHY160003"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 82944000, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6573459", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T06:06:41Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-19T18:08:46Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-17T18:08:44Z", "RequestedSlots": 480, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-17T06:06:41Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-19T18:08:46Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6573459.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 40646400}], "name": "TG-PHY160003", "principal_investigator": "Farhat N Beg", "field_of_science": "Physics (PHY)", "project_abstract": "The generation of multi-MeV ion beams driven by intense ultra-short laser pulses has been extensively studied.

In order to make ion beams to be most useful for applications, minimal beam divergence and narrow energy spread are desirable.

Thus, extensive numerical modeling should be carried out in order to better understand the optimal conditions for high-energy heavy-ion beam production.

In doing so, they can have both constructive and destructive impact on their hosts. Constructively, TEs provide a wealth of new genetic material for natural selection to act upon. Destructively, TEs promote genome instability via ectopic recombination, chromosome instability, and mutation. To counter the negative impacts TEs can have on their hosts, mechanisms have evolved to suppress TE expression, including DNA methylation and establishment of repressive chromatin. Prior to repression, TEs must be recognized as non-self DNA, and very little is known about what influences host recognition aside from the machinery involved (ie: small RNAs, Krppel-associated box domain containing zinc finger proteins [KRAB-ZFPs]) and that all known recognition mechanisms are sequence-dependent. Our understanding of the host response to TE invasion is particularly poor in mammals, in part because relatively few TEs all retrotransposons- have been recently active in human and mouse, as compared to other model organisms. To better understand how mammalian hosts respond to TEs, this proposal will utilize the vespertilionid (vesper) bats, whose genomes, unlike other mammals, have undergone numerous recent waves of transposition from a wide range of TEs, including DNA transposons and Helitrons. Specifically, this proposal will determine how acquisition of host-derived sequences by TEs, which has been commonly observed in various organisms, modulates the level at which TEs are recognized and silenced. We will test two fundamental hypotheses: (i) TEs with different histories and replication strategies are silenced differentially and (ii) acquisition of host sequences confers resistance against host TE defense systems. To test this, will we determine both the repression (Aim 1: methylome, chromatin accessibility, and KAP1 mediated rpression using MeDIP/MRE-Seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq respectively) and expression (Aim 2: RNA-sequencing) level of TEs in multiple tissues from three vesper bat species and one phylostomid bat and assess how acquisition of host sequence impacts the silencing process. The proposed research will address, for the first time, how host recognition and repression responses differ between RNA and DNA transposons, as well as provide insight into a possible mechanism for how TEs might evade recognition.

This diversity is unexpected in current theoretical models, which predict primarily old stellar populations in low-mass objects. The topic of star formation histories of dwarfs has also received significant attention recently in the context of possible small-scale problems of the LCDM model: if episodic bursts of star formation inject energy into dwarfs' dark matter halos, it may provide a natural explanation of the observed low densities of dwarf galaxies within LCDM.\n\nOur simulations will adopt physically-motivated, explicit feedback prescriptions that are fixed by our knowledge of stellar evolution.

Energy conversion processes, such as photoelectrochemical (PEC) decomposition of water by solar energy remains one of the most desirable hydrogen production method for post fossil-fuel energy employment. For optimal use of solar energy, the optically visible range of the solar spectra must be used. To absorb maximum solar energy, the desired photo-electrode in PEC processes must be a semiconductor of band gap around 2.0 eV, and the positions of its band edges must be matched with the water-splitting potentials. In addition, these photo-electrodes must be stable in aqueous solutions. Semiconductors satisfying all these criteria are not naturally available. So to achieve suitable photo-electrode materials, the electro-chemical properties of the materials and their response to defect/alloy formation must be understood. Among the semiconductors, transition metal oxides are of particular interest due to their low cost and relatively high stability in aqueous media. However, oxides are complex materials because of the strong electron-electron interactions. Double cation oxides, like delafossites materials are very promising in this respect. Cu-delafossites are very attractive because of their potential flexibility to tune their electro-chemical properties. These are bi-metallic oxides (CuMO2, where M is another metal with appropriate oxidation states) with the possibility to vary their chemical properties by forming alloys between different delafossites. Here we are proposing to theoretically study the electronic and chemical properties of suitable Cu-based delafossites alloys for PEC photo-electrodes, and to modify its chemical properties by band-engineering approach. We will employ density functional theory and its\u2019 appropriate extensions for this purpose. In the proposed research, we will develop a series of delafossite alloys, in both bulk and nano-crystal phases, and calculate their chemical and optical properties to meet the challenges of designing a set of suitable photoelectrodes which satisfy the above criteria. Formation and identification of the right alloys should enable us (i) to tune the band gap and band edge positions to match the water-splitting potentials, (ii) to minimize the effects of localized 3d-band near the band edges to provide higher electron/hole mobility, and (iii) to enhance the optical absorptions at the fundamental band gaps. Our proposed theory/computational research will provide a basic chemical understanding of these materials, which will in turn give guidance to electronically \u201cdesign\u201d, pre-screen and identify the desirable photo-electrodes in expeditious manner.", "pi_institution": "University of Texas at Arlington"}, "TG-CTS140009": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID":

are used for the production of fuels, chemicals, and the abatement of harmful emissions. Modern catalysis exists for about 100 years, but catalyst design and development remains by and large a time-consuming experimental trial-and-error process. The discovery of density functional theory (DFT) and the availability of large computational resources have already started to have a significant impact on our understanding of catalysis, and more importantly, they become increasingly applicable for the in silico design of new catalytic materials. The most successful approach for the identification of novel catalysts is known as computational catalyst screening, which encompasses three main steps: (i) the identification of the dominant reaction mechanism and the key reaction intermediates; (ii) the determination of a small set of catalytic reactivity descriptors that can predict reactivity and selectivity trends; and (iii) the calculation of these reactivity descriptors on new catalysts.\nIn the PIs group at the University of Houston (UH) we apply computational catalysis techniques, primarily DFT, to study catalytic process that enable the more efficient use of natural resources.

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create signi?cant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC\u2019s Stampede machine, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a signi?cant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This con?uence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this   work. \n\nTo address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi?cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. \n\nThis work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualizaiton capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that ef?ciently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs.

The unique electronic structure of graphene gives rise to many outstanding features and broad potential applications. However, the lack of a finite band gap is a big obstacle for the application of graphene on practical microelectronic devices because the intrinsic-graphene-based transistor cannot be switched off by the controlling voltage. Therefore, how to generate a finite band gap and, moreover, how to control the band gap are urgent and important research tasks.\n\nExperimental and theoretical studies have shown a few approaches to modify the electronic structure and band gap of graphene and bilayer graphene. We will focus on two of them; one is the chemical adsorption of molecules onto the graphene sheet; the other one is applying electric field to induce a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. For the first research topic, we plan to carry out first-principles studies to reveal how the molecules are adsorbed by graphene at the quantum-mechanics level and discover what kind of patterns these molecules prefer to form. For the second research topic, we will perform the first-principles calculation to study how the applied electric field induces a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. Many-electron effects will be included for the first time. Through this study we expect to explain the discrepancy between the prior theoretical calculations and experimental measurements and explore how important many-electron effects are in the electronic structure of two-dimensional semimetals. Finally, the change of the electronic structure induced by above methods will definitely have impact on the optical response of graphene and bilayer graphene. We plan to study optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene under an applied electric field with many-electron effects included. Through this study, we hope to understand how electron-hole interactions modify the infrared optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene with a finite band gap.\n\nIn order to realize above research plans, a powerful and efficient parallelized computing platform is of importance. Therefore, we write this proposal to TeraGrid for necessary computing allocation. We believe that these proposed plans will not only improve our understanding of the electronic structure and optical response of graphene but also significantly contribute to practical applications of this novel material.

Our previous SciDAC work has made significant progresses in addressing how land-atmosphere coupling processes determine precipitation and surface air temperature, what the most important subgrid scale processes coupling land to the atmosphere are, and how they can be efficiently represented in a climate model. The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a systematic subgrid scaling framework for the land component of the CCSM based upon our past progress. It will consist of four elements: i) a complex vegetation tiling representation; ii) an orographic tiling system; iii) a tiling system to describe a distribution of water table parameters that derives a realistic statistical model of wetland; iv) extension of our current work on precipitation intensity scaling that incorporates statistical estimation of precipitation intensities based on the physics of the CAM convective parameterization. The four elements will use the same set of tile computational components. They will have an infrastructure of the highest quality data currently available including the latest satellite-based MODIS land products and high resolution digital elevation data to describe the land surface. The scaling (tiling) system is expected to provide a better base for development of dynamic vegetation carbon modeling and a more realistic description of the land hydrological and radiation environment that will improve the prediction of land surface fluxes.

For Mhp1, we aim to test a new simulation method that can be used to predict unknown conformations of transmembrane proteins. This protein is an ideal test case because the outward-facing, outward-facing occluded and inward-facing structures have been determined from x-ray diffraction. Studies on EmrE will probe the structure and function of this protein. Another objective is to study the attachment mechanism of Osh4 to ER and PM of yeast.

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal. We gained experience working on Ranger via a start-up application that was granted to our group. \n", "pi_institution": "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"}, "QUANTRANS": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kujj2009", "Name": "myMPI", "Extension": {"Priority": 1309, "LocalAccount": "Impacts-of-near-term"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 230400, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6578482", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:08:38Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T18:32:10Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:32:10Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:08:38Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T18:32:10Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6578482.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 130432}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kujj2009", "Name": "myMPI", "Extension": {"Priority": 1307, "LocalAccount": "Impacts-of-near-term"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 230400, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6578476", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:07:42Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T18:27:13Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:27:13Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:07:42Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T18:27:13Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6578476.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 139936}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kujj2009", "Name": "myMPI", "Extension": {"Priority": 1307, "LocalAccount": "Impacts-of-near-term"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 230400, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6578478", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:08:03Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T18:27:13Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:27:13Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:08:03Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T18:27:13Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6578478.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 139936}, {"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "kujj2009", "Name": "myMPI", "Extension": {"Priority": 1307, "LocalAccount": "Impacts-of-near-term"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 230400, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6578480", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:08:15Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-18T18:30:12Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:30:12Z", "RequestedSlots": 32, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T06:08:15Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-18T18:30:12Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6578480.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 134208}], "name": "Impacts-of-near-term", "principal_investigator": "Tushar A Sinha", "field_of_science": "Surficial Processes", "project_abstract": "My research involves implementation of large scale processed based land surface models such Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) over the conterminous US as well as fully coupled surface water -

It is critically important to determine how these three properties are inter-related if one hopes to fully understand how proteins perform their myriad biological functions. The immediate focus of our research is to determine a mechanistic basis for enzyme function in the RNA polymerase from Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We employ allosteric inhibitors as chemical probes that modulate the physical properties of the enzyme in order to better understand how these properties allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. There is evidence that allosteric inhibitors can perturb the structure and dynamics of the enzyme in a way that modulates its function. However, the large amounts of structural data available for NS5B have not yet provided a mechanistic understanding of allosteric inhibition, suggesting that dynamics may be the missing link between inhibitor binding and altered enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an optimal tool to study this problem as it provides detailed information about both structure and dynamics. \n\tBy understanding the mechanistic origin of allostery in HCV polymerase we will obtain a deeper understanding of the function of this enzyme, information that is relevant not only to HCV, but also to other viral polymerases and nucleic acid enzymes. Moreover, these studies help to define the ways in which ligands allosterically regulate the function of biomolecules, a topic that is ubiquitous in the field of biochemistry. These studies further our understanding of how proteins function to induce biological effects and how their functions are modulated by the action of small molecules. \n\tOur evaluation of code performance results from comparing all-atom MD simulations performed for the HCV NS5B enzyme using the UMBC computing cluster with simulations carried out on TACC Ranger. The UMBC cluster consists of 82 compute nodes. While it performs at a high level, this resource is shared by the entire campus and does not offer enough CPUs to support high usage by our group members and other campus users. This is the primary reason we seek an allocation of computing time from XSEDE. We request this time on TACC Ranger because this cluster is efficient, has ample amounts of computing power and short wait times. In addition, Ranger performs well for jobs using a moderate number of CPUs, such as those described in this proposal. We gained experience working on Ranger via a start-up application that was granted to our group. \n", "pi_institution": "University of Maryland, Baltimore County"}, "TG-DMR090071": {"jobs": [{"Associations": {"ResourceID": null, "UserDomainID": null, "ActivityID": [], "EndpointID": null, "ShareID": "urn:glue2:ComputingShare:normal.stampede.tacc.xsede.org"}, "LocalOwner": "tbaruah", "Name": "gopor_hl", "Extension": {"Priority": 1450, "LocalAccount": "TG-DMR090071"}, "CreationTime": "2016-02-18T17:40:08Z", "State": ["ipf:running", "slurm:RUNNING"], "RequestedTotalWallTime": 8121600, "Queue": "normal", "LocalIDFromManager": "6578355", "ComputingManagerSubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T05:21:37Z", "ComputingManagerEndTime": "2016-02-20T15:54:44Z", "StartTime": "2016-02-18T16:54:44Z", "RequestedSlots": 48, "Owner": "unknown", "SubmissionTime": "2016-02-18T05:21:37Z", "EndTime": "2016-02-20T15:54:44Z", "ID": "urn:glue2:ComputingActivity:6578355.stampede.tacc.xsede.org", "UsedTotalWallTime": 130656}], "name": "TG-DMR090071", "principal_investigator": "Rajendra Zope", "field_of_science": "Condensed Matter Physics", "project_abstract": "\n We propose density functional theory based computational studies on optical, vibrational, structural and magnetic properties of several molecular scale systems.

The relatively fast turn-around time of RANS simulations enables optimizing the heat exchanger geometry, but there is considerable uncertainty in the solution of the optimization problem as a result of uncertainty in the RANS results. This uncertainty originates primarily from the use of turbulence and turbulent heat transfer models to provide closure for the Reynolds stress tensor and turbulent scalar flux vector. To enable robust optimization of the geometry, the uncertainty introduced by these models should therefore be quantified. \nDuring the PI's postdoc, a promising method to quantify turbulence model form uncertainty was developed. The method introduces realizable perturbations in the modeled quantities, i.e. the Reynolds stress tensor and turbulent heat flux vector, to determine plausible bounds on the quantity of interest. Providing a realistic definition of the perturbations is an outstanding challenge, and extremely valuable information can be obtained from high-fidelity large-eddy simulations, in which the Reynolds stress tensor and turbulent scalar flux vector are well resolved. \nThe requested start-up allocation will be used perform initial tests for large-eddy simulations of turbulent heat transfer using the opensource computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Based on these tests a research allocation will be requested to perform well-resolved large-eddy simulations in a number of simplified heat exchanger configurations.
