    abstract: 'To determine the 3-dimensional structures of a protein merely from its 1-dimensional sequence has been a major interest in the modern computational biology. Today, multiple approaches can be used to generate low-resolution models with 3~5 root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the native structure, while high-accuracy refinement is required to generate a high-resolution model (with 1~2 RMSD) from the low-resolution models. In the proposed project, we are going to combine parallel continuous simulated tempering (PCST) method, an enhanced sampling method we have developed recently, with the structured-based model (SBM) to further increase the sampling efficiency of rare events around important conformations in molecular simulation. The combined method will be applied in the refinement of 24 protein targets selected from the refinement category of the 10th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments held in 2012. All-atom molecular simulations in explicit solvent will be performed to generate candidate models. Our method has already been coded into the latest GROMACS package and the preliminary testing shows some encouraging results.' },

We use statistical mechanical modeling and classical molecular simulation to answer these questions. Currently we are pursuing three main thrusts with different computational needs.\n\n1) Structural and compositional changes in nanocrystals. Our goal is to accurately predict rates and mechanisms of cation-exchange in semiconductor nanocrystals. We are using neural networks to fit the energy landscape of accurate but computationally expensive reference methods like DFT. The resulting neural network potentials have accuracy comparable to the reference method, but generate molecular dynamics of large nanocrystal systems at a small fraction of the computational cost of the reference method. The computational work associated with this project mainly involves large numbers of DFT energy calculations (with a package like VASP) and the training of the neural networks.  \n\n2) Nucleation and growth of porous crystalline networks. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous materials with possible applications in catalysis and gas storage. Synthesis of these promising materials, however, proceeds mainly though trial and error, as the fundamental mechanisms of MOF formation are poorly understood. We develop coarse-grained models for the constituents of MOFs to reveal mechanisms of nucleation and growth and guide the development of new synthetic protocols. Computationally, this project primarily involves parallel molecular dynamics simulations of systems of up to hundreds of thousands of particles, with a package like LAMMPS.\n\n3) Self-assembly of nanoparticles. The assembly of nanoparticles into ordered arrays with useful optical, physical, and electrical properties is a main thrust in material science. Through rapid progress of synthetic protocols, nanoparticle building blocks and the materials they can be assembled into achieve a level of complexity comparable with that of atomistic and molecular crystals. Using coarse-grained modeling of colloidal nanoparticles, we develop experimentally feasible strategies for the assembly of complex materials, ranging from crystal structures formed by colloids with DNA-mediated interactions, to reconfigurable assemblies of particles driven far from equilibrium. Our main tool in this project are brownian dynamics computer simulations of large ensembles of nanoparticles.

The first detection of gravitational waves will push open a new window on the universe, comparable to the revolutions brought about by the development of radio, infrared, and high-energy (UV/X/$\\gamma$-ray) astronomy. Prime candidates for first detection are catastrophic events involving compact relativistic objects and their strongly nonlinear gravitational fields, in particular the coalescence of compact binaries and stellar collapse.\n\nThe challenge to meet the tremendous sensitivity requirements of gravitational wave detectors is paralleled by a computational modeling challenge: The detection, identification, and accurate determination of the physical parameters of sources relies on the detailed theoretical understanding of the source physics, and, in many cases, on the availability of waveform template banks, which are used to filter the detector signals. \n\nFor coalescing compact binaries, good analytical approximations for the gravitational waveforms are provided by post-Newtonian expansion techniques as long as the orbits are wide. For the last obits and merger, where the fields are particularly strong, and where one has the best chances of discovering entirely new physics, the full Einstein equations have to be solved numerically on supercomputers. The latter is true also and in particular for stellar collapse to a protoneutron star and the subsequent evolution to a core-collapse supernova or to stellar-mass black hole formation and a potential late-time gamma-ray burst. In this case, gravitational wave data can be complemented by information carried by neutrinos and electromagnetic waves.\n\nOur group of researchers has been involved at the heart of the recent progress in numerical relativity that is now allowing for robust simulations of compact binary coalescence, merger, and post-merger evolution as well as simulations of stellar collapse and core-collapse supernova evolution in full general relativity.\n \nHere we propose to carry out computational relativistic astrophysics modeling of stellar collapse and binary black hole coalescence, following novel research directions, employing new technical approaches while fundamentally relying on the community infrastructure Cactus that we helped create.\n\nOver the last few years, we have invested much work into black hole binary simulations and pioneered many of the techniques that render possible large scale parameter studies of these systems, and to construct from such simulations analytical template banks that describe the inspiral, merger and ringdown of black hole binaries. The binary black hole part of this project will make it possible to combine all these techniques and leap-frog black hole parameter studies in time for establishing data analysis strategies for the advanced generation of GW detectors that is expected to come online in 2014.\n\nWe have equally been at the forefront in the modeling of the general relativistic collapse of massive stars to neutron stars and in simulations of core-collapse supernovae and the accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs. In addition, we have recently developed and published much improved treatments and implementations for highly-relevant neutrino processes and the microphysical finite-temperature nuclear equation of state. The 3D stellar collapse projects that we propose here focus on the formation of black holes in failing core-collapse supernovae and on comparing 2D (axisymmetric) and 3D core-collapse supernova dynamics. The former is aimed at understanding the formation of gamma-ray burst central engines while the latter will help ascertain the influence of multi-D phenomena on the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism. In addition, these simulations will yield new and improved estimates of the gravitational wave signature of stellar collapse, core-collapse supernovae, and black hole formation.\n' },

Since self-assembly of biological molecules into ordered structures such occurs on long time scales and involves many units, detailed all-atom approaches are not entirely suitable because they are too computationally intensive. Instead, most spontaneous simulation studies to-date have been limited using extremely simplified models. Therefore, the proposal is to develop a coarse-grained model that contains adequate genuine protein-like and polymer-like character to mimic real molecules yet is simplified enough for the simulation of large systems over relatively long time scales. When coupled with the discontinuous molecular dynamics algorithm, a fast alternative to standard molecular dynamics, this model will enable the simulations of relatively large systems at a greater level of detail than have previously been possible. This in turn will enable investigation of the fundamental physics underlying self-assembly, examination of assembly kinetics and exploration of the energetic and morphological characteristics of assembled structures. This will result in a clearer understanding of how environmental conditions impact the formation, functionality and performance of architectures of nanostructures in hydrogel by peptide amphiphile molecules as a crucial precursor to their widespread application and acceptance. The objectives of this proposal are: (1) expand the current protein model to represent twenty different amino acids with adequate details to study the role of the polymeric segment on the folding process of the peptide segment on the same PA molecule; (2) examine the role of different peptide sequences and environmental conditions on the morphology of self-assembled PA nanostructures; (3) elucidate the kinetic mechanisms underlying the self-assembly process of PA nanostructures by PA molecules; and (4) investigate the relationship between biological stimulus and the morphology of networks of nanofibers or hydrogels.' },

In the previous year, we have successfully used XSEDE resources to run our massive computational jobs that provide us productive results of the molecular structures of several protein materials such as silk, elastin, collagen and intermediate filament. Specifically, for this renewal, we will continue focus on several representative biological protein materials from a material science perspective and investigate their role in mechanical materials phenomena. Our study will be very comprehensive as we will fully characterize the structure-mechanics relationship of each protein material to understand the molecular mechanism of their mechanics, as well as carry out comparative investigation to understand their unique roles in the corresponding physiological conditions. We will focus on addressing the property of several key materials: (i) collagenous tissues and bone, (ii) beta-sheet rich materials such as silk, and (iii) elastin, and including combinations of the above in so-called protein alloys.

In addition, we will conduct galaxy merger simulations to examine the later stages of SMBH binary inspiral and understand the impact of the SMBH evolution on the central regions of the host galaxy. The intermediate regime between gas-rich and gas-free galaxies is of particular interest, because it has not been modeled in detail and because a gravitational-wave recoil kick to the merged SMBH can either increase or decrease the size of the central stellar core, depending on the galactic gas content. These effects may therefore sharpen the observed dichotomy in central density profiles of elliptical galaxies. We have previously conducted numerous medium-resolution galaxy merger simulations on both university-based and XSEDE computing resources, many of which will be used in subsequent analysis. We have also successfully implemented and tested the narrow emission-line model for active SMBHs with Gadget-3 and Sunrise. With this underlying framework, the research proposed for XSEDE resources will represent a significant leap forward in our ability to model the co-evolution of SMBHs in galaxy mergers and to predict their signatures.' },

    abstract: 'The proposal seeks to understand the low frequency variability of the Tropical Western Atlantic Storms  (TWAS) and its relationship with Intra-Americas Seas (IAS) climate processes. Traditionally simulations and predictions beyond the NWP range for tropical Atlantic storms have largely been on their frequency of occurrence throughout the basin over the 6-month period from June through November. This type of forecast or simulation has limited application although they have demonstrated admirable skill on seasonal time scales and on longer time scales in their rendition of the 20th century variability. The success of this study could be a harbinger for attempting predictions of a subset of the tropical Atlantic storms that are geographically more limited in the basin (western Atlantic). Furthermore a majority of TWAS make landfall over continental North America. In addition, the TWAS climatologically has a characteristic dominance of genesis in June and November, which could also be potentially exploited if we understand their causality. Thus this proposal is relevant to NOAAs NGSP mission on climate adaptation and mitigation to the threat of potential land falling tropical storms in North America.\n\tThe proposed work will employ high-resolution (~10km) coupled ocean-atmosphere model centered over the IAS in an attempt to resolve the TWAS, the Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ), air-sea fluxes in the IAS, the diurnal variations in the region and capture the associated, intricate sub-surface ocean structure. In addition several sensitivity experiments are also proposed to understand the influence on the genesis and lifecycle of TWAS. This framework of regional coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling is deliberately chosen to afford the high resolution for multi-decadal integrations and limit the model drift by forcing the regional system with credible large-scale reanalysis (NCEP CFSR). The coupled GCMs have shown acute climatological bias in the IAS region with poor depiction of the associated variability in the boreal summer season.\n\tThe central objective of the proposal is to understand whether (and followed by how) IAS climate processes like the evolution of the IAS SST and sub-surface ocean evolution from the prior seasons, variability of CLLJ, air-sea fluxes in IAS, overlying atmospheric meridional cell can influence TWAS. The basis for this investigation is buttressed by several related observational evidence, a clear working knowledge of the models to be employed with its demonstration of use over another domain, and availability of computing resources to conduct the proposed integrations.\n' },

    abstract: 'Next-generation energy systems, such as fuel cells, nuclear reactors, batteries, advanced oil and gas exploration systems will require materials that perform reliably under increasingly extreme conditions. Examples of extreme conditions encountered in energy systems include exposure to chemically reactive  corrosive  environments as aqueous fluids in fossil and nuclear plants, fuel cells, and water splitting; reactive and non-reactive gases at extreme temperatures and pressures as in solid oxide fuel cells, hydrogen transmission and storage, nuclear reactors; ionic liquids in fuel cells and batteries; steam, gases and hydrocarbons in oil shale processing, coal liquefaction. The chemical reactivity in these environments is further accelerated in the presence of mechanical loads and radiation fields. For the general infrastructure, it is not uncommon to quote 3-5% of the Gross National Product of any country as the corrosion bill to the society [1]. Overcoming the barriers caused by the inability of todays materials to function reliably in these extremes is a major challenge to enable secure, affordable energy with minimal adverse environmental impacts. Revolutionary advances are needed in reducing the degradation of materials due to reactivity in these aggressive conditions to meet the future energy challenges. For this purpose, a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of unit processes that occur at the atomic level under such corrosive environments is needed (1).\nThe goal of this research is to quantitatively uncover the mechanisms that govern the corrosion kinetics in two energy-related contexts. The results of this research will ultimately lead to the development of physics-based predictive models for corrosion and guide the design of more durable material surfaces. The first context is the corrosion of zirconium alloys that are currently the canonical nuclear fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors (the most commonly used nuclear plants in the world). The second is corrosion of low-chromium steels in oil fields containing hydrogen sulfide rich fluids. While these two systems look different in application, the scientific commonality we focus is on the stability of passive surface films that are critical in corrosion of both material systems - those are the zirconium oxide surface films in the former, and iron sulfide surface films in the latter. We will accomplish our goal through a multiscale computational approach linking first-principles electronic structure methods with atomistic simulations. In the rest of this section we describe the current state-of-knowledge of the mechanistic aspects of corrosion in the above mentioned energy-related systems. This description will allow us later on defining our Proposed Research and justifying the requested computational resources for this research. \n' },

Currently, the edge states of these clusters are believed to be the catalytically active sites. Moreover, the activity of these sites are enhanced with the presence of point defects that result in missing sulfur atoms. The Bartels group specializes in ultra high vacuum growth and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of MoS2 films. Complementing these experiments with theoretical work, we model the films using density functional theory (DFT), specifically the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP), to give further insight into film defects, substrate interactions, and activity with titrate molecules. When we consider the periodicity of the MoS2 film and that of the underlying substrate, we create a unit cell upon which the two separate crystals are commensurate with one another. Often, this process results in a relatively giant model that is too large for our home computer clusters to handle. For this reason, we are applying for XSEDE time to run analysis of these MoS2 films, their noted defects, and their interactions with titrant molecules.' },

These factors control the morphology and performance of this important class of Li ion battery cathode materials. 2) We have calculated the bending strain energy, defect energy and interfacial energy in TiS2 nanotubes, and determined the optimal bending angle. These calculations permit a better understanding of the structure of inorganic nanotubes, which is crucial to accurate calculations of their electrochemical and other properties for Li ion battery applications. 3) We constructed the Pourbaix diagrams for both bulk and 0.5 to 2 nm diameter Pt nanoparticles, which helps us understand and improve the stability of Pt nanocatalysts. 4) We developed a method based on the cluster expansion formalism that makes highly accurate thermodynamic calculations of nano-structured materials computationally feasible, and applied it successfully to our test system of Au-Pd nanoparticles to predict ground state structures. This method allows us to extend our computational work to alloyed nanoparticles that are too large for the fully ab initio approach.

This work is of interest to engine manufacturers who are investing large amount of resources in improving engine efficiency (reducing carbon emissions) and reducing harmful emissions like NOx, CO, particulate matter, and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). Two specific types of engines are of interest here: low-temperature combustion (LTC) stratified-charge compression-ignition (SCCI) engines and lean-burn natural-gas engines. In these engines the flow field is characterized by a highly fluctuating strain field that interacts with the flame/chemistry. Studying the engine flow field by employing direct-numerical simulations (DNS) is still impractical with current computational resources. So, the approach adopted by the PI and his research team is as follows: (1) carry out DNS (under engine conditions) in canonical configurations to understand turbulence/chemistry interactions, (2) employ the data from these simulations to assess the accuracy of existing subgrid-scale turbulence/chemistry interaction models or develop new models, and (3) employ the models in reacting LES in engines. The current request for resources is for (1) and (2). Two fuels, methane (surrogate for natural gas) and n-heptane (surrogate for diesel), are selected because their oxidation chemistry is reasonably well known and reduced chemical mechanisms are available. Methane will be employed for spark-ignited premixed-charge studies of relevance in natural-gas engines, and n-heptane will be employed in autoignited stratified-charge studies of relevance to low-temperature combustion compression-ignited engines.\n\nThe configurations will be 2D rectangular and 3D cuboid geometries in which a decaying turbulence flowfield is initialized. The gas will be either premixed methane/air mixture with an ignition kernel or an autoigniting stratified n-heptane/air mixture. 4.8 million SUs are requested to carry out eight simulations for the methane/air premixed mixture and 2.12 million SUs for the n-heptane/air stratified-charge mixture, adding up to a total of 6.92 million SUs. Four of the simulations for methane will be carried out in 2D with fairly detailed chemical mechanisms whereas the other four will be carried out in 3D with global mechanisms. All n-heptane/air stratified charge mixture computations will be carried out in 3D with a reduced mechanism for n-heptane oxidation. This work will build upon work that is being currently funded by NCSA grant number MCA06N038. The resources from NCSA in the last three years have led to 10 archival publications, 7 conference papers, and three Ph.D. graduates.  The NCSA resources will be supplemented by the Rosen Center of Advanced Computing at Purdue University to carry out less intensive simulations involving global mechanisms in 2D and detailed mechanisms in 1D. Funding for this work is provided by Caterpillar, Inc. The company is developing both natural gas engines and low-temperature combustion engines. The results of the work, as in prior work that we have carried out using NCSA resources, will be reported in the open literature. The Caterpillar funding has a separate component which supports work that is specific to their engines. This will not be carried out using NCSA resources.\n' },

The interpolymer interaction is responsible for a property like stiffness in polymers.  Cellulose and fibroin are used as case studies in this project.  Cellulose is a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of (14) linked D-glucose units found in cotton which is one of major crops grown in the Mississippi delta region of the state of Arkansas.  Fibroin consists of the beta pleated sheets of amino acids (Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala) and is a major component of silk.  Detailed computational studies of interpolymer interaction will provide vital insights into understanding tensile strength and bulk properties such as stiffness.  Some reports the study of mixture of cellulose and fibroin in acidic solution.  Comparison of these data may be useful in developing high-tech fabrics or materials for other industrial uses. \nThe PI plans to model and simulate the structure of these polymers using density functional theory.   The data values collected in these case studies will be compared to the experimental measurements of bulk phase tensile strength.  The preliminary data collections will be submitted for the NSF funding application to cover further in-depth investigations of the subject in near future.  \nIn order to obtain reasonable data, the model has to simulate the realistic 3D setup.  Starting with a monomer at the origin, the polymer chain is created along x-axis in such way to reduce the strain.  Then another chain is laid alongside of the first chain in y-axis direction.  The careful orientation of each polymer unit maximizes the interpolymer hydrogen bonding.  Therefore, slight offset must be introduced between chains.  The process is repeated to create a sheet.  Finally, at least two layers of polymer sheets are introduced along z-axis to complete the model.  The geometry of this 3D polymer structure is optimized to maximize the interpolymer interactions.  Several calculations must be repeated to adjust the interpolymeric bond length.  This includes directions along hydrogen bond and perpendicular to the hydrogen bond.  To estimate the required computational cost, the PI has performed calculations with minimal setup with fibroin polymer using standard desktop computers.  This minimal computational setup only uses a minimal basis set and two monomer units in each cell.  This setup does not produce enough data for meaningful comparison with the available bulk phase data.  Computations on more realistic unit cell using at least PBEPBE/6-31G* level ,  of theory is necessary for the task.  Hence, the help of high performance computing capability is necessary for this study.  This also may be a good opportunity to test the usage of periodic boundary conditions in the model of complex polymers.\nComputational data for fibroin polymer from the initial study will be reported at the local conference Create@State 2015 at Arkansas State University (with Arkansas Bioscience Institute) within next two months.  More refined data with cellulose will be reported during the fall semester 2015 at INBRE conference.  These data generated through XSEDE seed will be used to write a NSF proposal for further investigations of the subject during the summer semester 2015.  \nThe PI requests 30,000 service unit (SU) from Blacklight, 40,000 from Gordon and 40,000 from Stampede.

Our lab computationally studies Influenza hemagglutinin (HA2), the homotrimeric viral surface protein that facilitates host-viral membrane fusion both by introducing its fusion peptides into the host membrane and through a large conformational rearrangement. Our coarse-grained studies have brought up interesting questions that are important in order to understand the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by HA2. Here, to address these questions, we request a total of 4.7 million SUs on Stampede supercomputer, to perform explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations with a newly developed single-copy enhanced sampling method and the CHARMM36 force field. Project 1 needs 2.5 million SUs to map out the free energy landscape of the B-loop domain of HA2, which undergoes a loop-to-coiled-coil transition that presents the fusion peptides to the host membrane. There is much controversy in the field as to whether the B-loop is enthalpically-downhill driven (spring-loaded), or whether there is a significant entropic barrier to its transition. Our simulations will conclusively discern the mechanism of this transition. Project 2 needs 2.2 million SUs to address the dynamics and structure of fusion peptides once they have been introduced into the host membrane. Through simulations, we will find out whether the fusion peptides aggregrate, form a specific functional oligomer, or simply provide an anchor for HA2. Prospective results from these two projects will shed light on the generic membrane fusion mechanism shared by influenza viruses and other viruses such as HIV and Ebola. Additionally, an understanding of the molecular mechanism for fusion will highlight the vulnerable regions of HA2 on which to concentrate drug research.' },

This will extend and improve on work over the last year using a previous XSEDE research allocation (Resolving Feedback from Super Massive Back Holes in a Realistic Interstellar Medium; PI Hopkins), particularly taking advantage of the numerical and physical advances that allocation enabled to generate a systematic suite of simulations studying feedback in different environments, which will be used to address a vast array of fundamental science questions.\nIn these simulations, the ISM will be explicitly resolved into diffuse and dense molecular cloud phases, with stars forming only in high-density bound cores, while both gravitational capture and accretion into the sub-pc scales of the viscous accretion disk by the BH will be explicitly resolved. When stars form, or mass is accreted onto the BH, energy and momentum is injected into the surrounding media via stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. We self-consistently incorporate the effects of radiation pressure (from stars and the AGN accretion disk), stellar and accretion disk winds, supernovae types I & II, and photo-ionization as well as Compton heating (by stars and AGN). This generates explosive galactic outflows and drives turbulence within both dense and diffuse gas in galaxies.\nWe will use these simulations to for the first time study accretion and feedback from AGN while simultaneously treating the ISM on galactic scales in a realistic fashion, without ad hoc prescriptions which have been used in previous numerical studies. In this investigation, our proposed simulations focus on a range of scales, from small-scale simulations of the obscuring torus region which can resolve inflow into scales of the viscous BH accretion disk, up through fully galaxy-scale simulations. This will allow us to simulate a range of different processes and develop an understanding of how small-scale physics of AGN accretion and driving of accretion-disk winds impacts galactic star formation and evolution at a much larger scale.\nBecause of their unique realism and range of physics incorporated, the proposed simulations will be used to address a wide range of current open scientific questions. We will study the evolution of BH accretion rates, generation of nuclear and galactic-scale winds, the interaction of AGN- driven and stellar-driven galactic outflows, the effects of AGN feedback on galactic star formation, and the nature of BH-host galaxy correlations. XSEDE resources are necessary to provide the computational power to perform these simulations, as the resolution demands exceed what can be achieved with local computing resources. We will use the new code GIZMO, that allows us to run simulations with either a moving-mesh method, or a novel formulation of smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH). These simultaneously capture many of the advantages of Eulerian (grid) and Lagrangian codes, and allow us to directly isolate their discrepancies.\nWe have successfully performed test runs using the production version of the code on local computing clusters, and have run previous simulations using Stampede at TACC. This allows us to estimate runtime requirements for the proposed simulations, totaling 3.6 million SUs.' },

These beta-lactum antibiotics chemically react with some cell-wall- forming enzymes of bacteria, generally known as penicilin-binding proteins (PBP) to stop the formation of trans-peptide-bond in cell-wall and thus stop the cell-wall growth.\nThe central focus of the current project will be the computational investigation of the chemical-reaction between beta-lactums and PBPs at an atomistic resolution, especially the first step of the antibiotic-substrate reaction known as the acylation. Specific plans of the project will be to use novel methods of QM/MM-based free-energy simulation and constant pH-based MD simulation to :\n1) Unequivocally determine the correct protonation states of the key residues in the active site of the enzyme.\n2) Free-energetically investigate the competing antibiotic-substrate reaction pathways.\nMost of the simulations will be done with parallel software packages CHARMM and GROMACS, which are known to scale reasonably well in supercomputers of XSEDE and hence the proposed project will be highly benefitted from access to XSEDE resources.

    abstract: 'This three year plan for research focuses on the dynamics of oceanic double-diffusive convection, an important small-scale mixing process driven by the two orders of magnitude difference in diffusivities of heat and salt in seawater. The significance of double-diffusive mixing for water-mass transformation and determining the structure of the temperature-salinity relationship in all oceans has become increasingly clear over the last few years. One of the most intriguing aspects of double-diffusive convection is related to its ability to transform smooth vertical gradients into stepped structures consisting of mixed layers separated by thin, stratified interfaces. Recent field data from the tropical Atlantic has shown that vertical fluxes due to salt fingers, within thermohaline staircases, are significantly (by an order of magnitude) enhanced when compared to non-staircase regions with similar stratifications. Thus, it is vital to improve our understanding of thermohaline staircase formation, evolution and large-scale consequences. Double-diffusive mixing plays a fundamental role in the oceans ability to transport and sequester heat, salt, nutrients, pollutants and carbon dioxide. Yet, this small-scale process is not included in most large-scale oceanographic models, including operational Navy models, which severely limits their predictive capabilities. This research plan is aimed at quantifying the double-diffusive transport in both smooth gradients and thermohaline staircases, developing clear insight into the origin of staircases and specifying conditions for their formation. The proposed study will involve numerical process modeling using a pseudo-spectral code, which integrates the Navier-Stokes equations of motion (Boussinesq approximation). Inferences from the model runs will be used to interpret the oceanic fine- and microstructure data and the results of laboratory experiments. Advanced support is requested for collaboration with Dr. Gabriele Jost, who is familiar with the double-diffusive codes and has collaborated with the NPS computational fluid dynamics group in the past. This collaboration involves application of the advanced numerical methods to Double-Diffusion problems. The goal of this collaboration is to perform a series of Direct Numerical Simulations that will form the basis of a parameterization scheme for the General Circulation Models (GCMs). Prof Radko has developed code of his own to solve DDC problems for 2D (SF2D) and 3D (SF3D) problems. The parallelization in these codes is based on OpenMP. In order to handle realistic problem sizes, more computational power is needed than what the current OpenMP version delivers on general multi-core node clusters. SF3D lends itself to MPI parallelization. The 2D version (SF2D) may be a good candidate for running on GPGPU based nodes. Special support is requested for the port of SF2D to a GPGPU system, the development of an MPI based version of SF3D and for the evaluation of existing MPI-based codes and their suitability to the current project.' },

As a turbulent spot moves downstream, it spreads laterally  until it merges with other growing spots and the entire span becomes turbulent.  Although the spots themselves have an interesting structure,   they appear much like small arrowhead-shaped  regions of fairly developed turbulence and so should be subject   to means of control  already developed for a fully turbulent boundary layer.  Although the development of spots of turbulence may be unavoidable,  perhaps their growth can be constrained by a riblet covered surface.  So even though having riblets covering much of an aircraft surface where the bou  ndary layer is  already turbulent does not usually pay off, riblets applied locally to extend th  e end of the laminar  region have greater potential leverage since there is such   a large increase in shear stress  in a turbulent flow and since small areas of riblets are cheap.    We are directly simulating this process. The direct numerical simulations  of the Navier Stokes equations are done in a channel-like domain   that is very long  in the streamwise direction. The emphasis of the work is on studying  the fundamental nature of the flows generated during the transition process  and how such small scale textures interact with the turbulent vortex  structures in a wall-bounded flow.    We have also begun a project to model rarefied atmospheric flows on our  moon after a comet impact an on Jupiter\'s moon Io. On Io, flows of sulfur  dioxide gas arise from sublimating frost patches and from active volcanic  plumes. We simulate these types of plumes with a direct simulation Monte  Carlo method.    Our codes now run well in parallel. The turbulent flow codes run in OpenMP  on Champion and the stochastic molecular codes in MPI on Champion or Lonestar.' },

    abstract: 'Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable feedstock that may produce valuable chemicals and transportable liquid fuels. A process that appears economically feasible is the thermal break-down of biomass via pyrolysis to form bio-oil, which cannot be directly used as fuel because of high oxygen contents, and thus requires the catalytic upgrade preferably by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to remove the oxygen. During the thermal breakdown, lignin, the major component of the biomass is decomposed into phenolic compounds such as phenol, cresol, guaiacol and syringol and their derivatives. Efforts are required in the design and development of active catalysts that can deoxygenate these phenolic compounds, which rely on the understanding of the detailed mechanisms for the HDO of phenolic compounds. The first principle density functional theory (DFT) methods enable us to understand the structure of the catalyst and the chemical reactions at the atomic level, and thus give us more in-depth understanding of how the specific atomic structure of the catalyst and its complex reaction environment influence the catalytic performance. In this proposed work, we use density function theory to explore the fundamental mechanisms that govern the HDO of phenolic compounds on the supported metal catalysts and establish the micro-kinetic model that precisely describe the kinetics, and explore the important structure-activity relationships that can be used to guide the development of more active catalysts. We propose to investigate the effects of the composition of metal by examining the pathways of HDO of m-cresol on Pt, Ni and Fe promoted Ni surfaces. We also propose to investigate the influence of the support by exploring the active sites on the Pt particle with the reducible metal oxide TiO2 support. Finally, we will examine different phenolic compounds such as phenol, cresol and 1,2-benzenediol to explore the structural effects of these phenolic compounds on their HDO reactivity. This proposed theoretical work will be used to provide important guidance to the experimental work carried out in our group.' },

Building upon the substantial advancements we have made in the first 2 years of this LRAC award, we will continue our simulations of high mass star formation by extending our study of collapse and fragmentation of turbulent cores with no outflows and single-frequency radiation to explore a larger number of realizations and a wider range of parameters.\nWe will include for the first time, the combined effect of feedback from radiation and its interaction with feedback from protostellar outflows in an effort to pin down a mapping between the properties of cores and their environments such as column density, and the masses and multiplicities of the stellar systems to which they collapse.  The first exploratory simulations with ionization will be performed. We will also continue our ground breaking studies of multiple low mass star formation by studying the collapse of magnetized turbulent clumps with AMR and comparing results to our pure hydrodynamic models to gauge the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process. In addition, we will perform the same simulation with a 1000 solar mass turbulent clump that we have used in our current studies of star formation in turbulent clumps (Offner, Klein and McKee, 2008) but with magnetic fields. This study, now including magnetic fields, will complement our studies of core and star formation this current year without fields and enable us to delineate the effects of magnetic fields on star formation. To explore the effects of outflows on low mass star formation, we will also perform high-resolution AMR simulations of cluster formation including the feedback from such outflows using stellar evolutionary and wind feedback models. To do these simulations we will take advantage of our implementation of sink particles in Eulerian grids, which we have previously used to handle stellar evolution and feedback in our studies of high mass star formation. We will continue simulations of low mass star formation with radiative transfer, thereby addressing the effect of radiation feedback on core fragmentation and stellar multiplicity, first using our grey flux-limited implementation (GFLD) in ORION and then comparing with simulations using our newly developed Multi-Frequency Grey radiation transfer.

    abstract: 'Bimetallic materials have shown great promise for the development of superior catalysts.  The recent surge of new interest in catalysis by gold has led researchers to investigate the effects of adding gold to other metals. Alloying with palladium has been shown to form a bimetallic catalyst having superior activity, selectivity and stability towards various catalytic reactions such as carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation and hydrodesulfurization. In particular, palladium-gold (Pd-Au) alloy nanoclusters dispersed on titania (TiO2) often exhibit significantly improved efficiency for selective oxidation reactions, compared to Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2. Bimetallic Pd-Au catalysts have also recently received much attention for hydrogen fuel cell applications, because they are much less sensitive to CO poisoning than pure platinum or even platinum-ruthenium alloy catalysts. While mechanisms underlying the synergetic effect are ambiguous, recent evidence suggests that the reactivity of oxide-supported bimetallic metal nanocatalysts is determined by a complex combination of metal-metal interactions in metal clusters, metal-support interactions, and metal cluster sizes and shapes. However, little is known about the atomic structure and composition of Pd-Au nanoclusters, let alone their interfacial interactions with the TiO2 support.  \r\nUsing first principles calculations this research focuses on developing a better understanding of the alloying effects of supported bimetallic nanoclusters towards various catalytic reactions.  Special emphasis will be placed on understanding how the metal-metal and metal-support interactions determine the structure and composition of the supported metal alloys, and in turn their chemical reactivity.  For model systems, we will examine bimetallic Pd-Au thin films and TiO2-supported Pd-Au mixed nanoclusters, and their reactivity towards oxidation of CO and H2, relative to their pure counterparts.  The Pd-Au and Au-Pd/TiO2 systems will serve as excellent models for studying the nature of supported bimetallic nanocatalysts, particularly gold and palladium-group-metal alloys.  While current experimental techniques alone are limited to providing complementary real space information, the synergetic interplay between theory and experiment will contribute greatly to developing a better understanding of the structure, composition, and reactivity of oxide-supported Pd-Au nanoclusters.  Progress from this proposal will also offer an invaluable guide to the rational design and fabrication of bimetallic nanocluster-based materials for various catalytic applications.' },

Such calculations can only be carried out with the advanced TeraGrid computational resources. The size and\ncomplexity of the function of these proteins pose a great challenge for computational studies. Over the last funding period, however, we have demonstrated through several published papers reported in the Progress Report, that large scale MD simulations can indeed significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of energy coupling and transport phenomena in these biomolecules. Due to limited space and the need to describe 6 projects, we have delegated the progress and discussion of our preliminary results\ncompletely to the Progress Report. Our extensive use of the allocation over the past funding period is the strongest evidence for the computational demands of such biomolecular systems.

The second project studies the deformation of three-dimensional droplets, bubbles and fluid bridges in restricted geometries, under the influence of low-Reynolds-number flows and gravity. The study involves developing Spectral Boundary Element methods to simulate the transient and steady-state behavior of fluid drops under an array of flows, eg. shear and Poiseuille flows. This algorithm has been parallelized using OpenMP directives resulting in a nearly linear decrease in CPU time with increasing the number of processors on NCSA IBM pSeries 690.' },

    abstract: '(1) Aquaporin study:\n\nAquaporins (AQPs) are a large family of integral membrane proteins, which facilitate the rapid and yet highly selective flux of water and other small solutes across biological membranes [1]. These proteins are present in all kingdoms of life, demonstrating their central role in maintaining normal physiology of all organisms. Since the first demonstration of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) from human red blood cells as a bona fide water channel, more than 450 individual AQPs have been identified and many family members are being functionally and structurally studied [2]. In silico experiments or, namely, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complimentary to in vitro experiments, have proven to be important in determining the mechanisms of permeation through aquaporins on the molecular level. In particular, the free-energy landscapes of the human AQP1 and of the E. Coli glycerol uptake facilitator GlpF, have been mapped in recent studies, [3-5] employing two equilibrium approaches: thermodynamics integration and adaptive biasing force methods as well as the non-equilibrium approach of steered MD (SMD). While consensus has been reached for the functions of the selection filter (SF) and the NPA motifs, the free energy profiles predicted do not quantitatively agree with one another. \nThe main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to resolve the disagreement of the existing studies of hAQP1 and GlpF; (2) to extend the MD studies to a number of important AQPs, exploring the free-energy landscapes of AQP0, AQP1, AQP4, AQP5, AQPM, PfAQP, GlpF and AQPZ for the following permeants: H2O, C3H5(OH)3, CO2, NO, H2O2, NH3, As(OH)3, Sb(OH)3, and Si(OH)4.\nSpecifically, we will use the structure files from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as the starting point. We will build lipid bi-layer to model the cell membrane and embed a given AQP tetramer in the membrane. We will solvate and ionize the AQP-membrane complex to simulate the physiological environment. We will employ the CHARMM 27 force fields to represent the all-atom interactions of the system and use the adapted NAMD 2.6 MD engine for equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics runs. We will pull the center of mass of a permeant molecule across a porin (channel) forward from the periplasm side to the cytoplasm side and then pull it back in the reverse direction. Along the forward and reverse pulling paths, we will measure the pulling forces and compute the work done to the permeant along the paths. From the work measurements, we will compute the free-energy profile along the permeation channel. We plan to implement this study first for water (H2O) and glycerol (C3H5(OH)3) and then for other permeants listed in the previous paragraph. If the requested support granted, we expect to accomplish the study for water and glycerol within one year and to generate enough preliminary data for an NIH proposal securing extramural funding support.\nWhen completed, the proposed research will (1) resolved the current discrepancies concerning the free-energy landscapes of water and glycerol permeating GlpF and (2) produce accurate mapping of the free-energy landscapes for important permeants through a number of physiologically importantly AQPs. In the long term, the proposed research will bear on determining the mechanisms of water-channel related diseases and finding their cures.\n\n[1] For a recent review, see The AQP Structure and Functional Implications, Handbook of Exp.

Herein we propose to obtain the potentials of mean force (PMF) for pair-interactions between functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in physiological saline. Four types of functionalization are built by coating the globular Au144 cluster each with 60 thiolate groups: GS-AuNP (glutathionate), PhS-AuNP (thiophenol), CyS-AuNP (cysteinyl), and p-APhS-AuNP (para-amino-thiophenol), which are, respectively, negatively charged, hydrophobic (neutral-nonpolar), hydrophilic (neutral-polar), and positively charged at neutral pH. The preliminary results, based upon 1000-ns experiments in silico of all-atom model systems under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions, confirm the behaviour expected of neutral (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) particles in dilute aqueous environment, but the PMF curves demonstrate that the charged AuNPs interact with one another in a unique way — mediated by H2O molecules and electrolyte (Na+,Cl¯) — in a physiological environment. In the case of two GS-AuNPs, the excess, neutralizing Na+ ions form a mobile (or ‘dynamic’) cloud of enhanced concentration between like-charged GS-AuNPs, inducing a moderate attraction (~ 25-kT) between them. And, to a lesser degree, for a pair of p-APhS-AuNPs, the excess, neutralizing Cl¯ ions (less mobile than Na+) also form a cloud of higher concentration between the two like-charged p-APhS-AuNPs, inducing weaker yet significant attractions (~ 12-kT). In the combination of one GS- and one p-APhS-AuNP, the direct, attractive Coulombic force is completely screened out while the solvation effects give rise to moderate repulsion between the two unlike-charged AuNPs. \nWith these preliminary results (published in PCCP) validating our approach, we will pursue similar studies of silver nannoparticles. We will study concentration effects of gold and silver nanoparticles in solutions of one nanoparticle type and solutions of their mixtures.' },

SiC has no native oxide. Instead it will decompose into SiO2 and "carbon" upon oxidation. Problematic in electronic materials is that not all carbon is removed through carbon monoxide during processing, leaving carbon at the interface behind. Such defects trap electron during transport through the devise and cause noise and failure. In mechanical applications, such "graphitic" segregation may deteriorate mechanical properties – or may be fortuitous since it retards further oxidation.\nWe will study different SiC|SiO2 interfaces using density functional calculations combined with structure modeling.

Our group has devised a novel hydrothermal method for synthesis of highly ordered antiferromagnetic (AFM) core and ferromagnetic (FOM) or ferrimagnetic (FIM) shell Cr2O3  based nanoparticles (NPs). By mimicking natural processes of mineral zoning formation under hydrothermal conditions, we are able to incorporate transition elements (M: Co, Fe, Ni) into a highly structurally ordered Cr2O3  based shell, to form Cr2O3-MxCr2-xO3 inverted core-shell NPs. The advantage of our method over others is the production of core-shell NPs having highly uniform structure throughout with minimal core-to-shell interface strain, creating an ideal nano-scale environment for spin exchange bias effects between the AFM core and FOM/FIM shell. Our primary objective is to investigate the mechanism of the exchange bias effect occurring at the Cr2O3-MxCr2-xO3 interface in order to develop a better understanding of the magnetic properties of our core-shell NPs.    \n\nWe plan to use a similar methodology as was recently employed by Gobert et al. to study the exchange bias mechanism in LaNiO3-LaMnO3 superlattices [1].

Existing transport theories such as the widely accepted solution-diffusion model do not intrinsically contain atomic level details, leaving the relation between the filtration performance and microscopic details elusive.  In the present study, we use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study reverse osmosis for the commonly used FT-30 polymeric membrane. The membrane model is computationally constructed by repetitively performing equilibrium MD simulations using NAMD [1], an MD code specifically for simulations of biomolecular systems, followed by applying cross-linking patches based on a heuristic method in which cross-links are formed when atoms in the molecular chains that need to cross-link are nearby [2]. Once the molecular structure of the membrane is assembled, the pressure driven flow of water at 300 K is established by applying constant forces to graphene sheets on the feed and the permeate sides. The transport of water/solutes is then obtained from the above long-time nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD). The transport characteristics of various organic solutes, urea, methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol, as well ionic solutes, Na+ and Cl-, are investigated. The effective membrane pore sizes and connectivity are characterized by a geometrical consideration and correlated with water/solute transport from NEMD simulations. The effects of solute sizes, solute solvation shells, solute-membrane interactions as well as inter-solute interactions are investigated. This ongoing research is focused on developing a molecular level understanding of the transport of organic solutes across polymeric membranes from information directly calculated from atomic level details.\n\nRefs.\n[1] J.

    abstract: 'Nearly every protein could be considered to go through an allosteric conformational change or have long-range effects between amino acids; one of the key challenges to modern structural biology is that of understanding and predicting these changes and their functional importance. Our long-term goal is to understand how signals travel through proteins by analyzing multi-amino acid pathway based allosteric mechanisms; for this purpose we employ  Light-Oxygen-Voltage 2 (LOV2) domains as model systems. These proteins provide a unique glimpse into allostery through their light activated conformational change, which has been determined to come from a single covalent bond formation distant from the site of action, and yet leads to domain-scale conformational changes that are coupled to a huge variety of functional outputs in different protein contexts. The use of this model system allows us to reduce the problem down to more simplistic terms, and using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations we will be able to provide insight into not only allostery but also the longstanding question of how LOV domains function. The major goals of our research are the following:\n1. Understanding the extent of large scale conformational changes in LOV2 domains by analyzing their energy landscapes. Using accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) simulations of LOV2 domains from A. sativa and A. thaliana, we will determine the accessible allosteric states of LOV2 proteins in both their active (light) and inactive (dark) states. Isolating these states will allow us to determine the mechanism that causes transitions between them.\n2. Determine the atomic level mechanism of conformational change in LOV2 domains. Data from the AMD simulations and equilibrium simulations started from low energy states in the AMD simulations will be used to determine the atomic level allosteric mechanism of conformational change. Because we anticipate these mechanistic properties to be highly multi-dimensional we will apply Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) simulations to ensure adequate sampling of the transitions between states, and plan to use both kernel based and tree based machine learning to help us uncover what is actually occurring.\n3. Perform an in silico mutational analysis to compare to a library of experimental mutants we have generated in an attempt to predict effects on function. Because proteins are so complex understanding the effects of mutations on function and allostery requires an atomic level view of what happens. We plan to simulate, using alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, five different AsLOV2 mutants, four of which been shown to have an effect on allosteric conformational change. We predict that accessibility of certain allosteric states will change based on the individual mutation and will use this data as a predictor of how well our simulations recapitulate the biophysical measurements.\n' },

The RTI occurs in a wide variety of atmospheric, oceanic, geophysical and astrophysical flows and, despite recent progress made through numerical simulations, remains poorly understood, e.g., the late-time turbulent multi-material mixing behavior for multimode initial conditions. The key difficulty is that the long transient of this initially laminar flow, i.e., turbulence is achieved only at late times. Furthermore, many numerical methods are based on the concept of implicit large-eddy simulation, where large scales are resolved but the small-scale dynamics are modeled purely using the numerical dissipation. Although successful in representing the large-scale behavior, it is far from clear that the energy dissipation and mixing processes at the small scales are accurately represented.\n\nThe objective of the proposed research is to investigate the late-time turbulence and mixing in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, with relevance to astrophysics. To achieve this objective, we propose to conduct direct numerical simulation (DNS) using non-dissipative methods, such that all the physics are resolved on the computational grid, and that the numerics no longer affect the solution. This will be achieved with a high-order accurate minimally dissipative kinetic-energy preserving and interface capturing scheme will be used. For this purpose, we request 2.5M SUs to perform a series of RTI simulations as detailed in the proposal. The XSEDE allocation will allow us to perform simulations at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers that the mixing transition is achieved. Our three-dimensional code uses the message-passing interface (MPI) for parallelization and HDF5 library for parallel I/O. High efficiency has been obtained for weak and strong scaling analysis conducted on Ranger and Lonestar up to 2048 cores.\n\nThe present hypothesis is that, by perturbing the interface using an existing turbulent velocity field to mimic multimode initialization, evolution to turbulence and higher Reynolds numbers can be achieved more rapidly. By solving the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations, we will quantify isotropy and intermittency of the decaying turbulence (i) first without gravity, (ii) then with a gravitational field. In the latter, we will make the region of initial turbulence larger to determine how turbulence ahead of the mixing region influences the instability growth. Through resolved calculations, we will be able to determine the mechanisms that govern the mixing.  We expect that the results will depend on a ratio of time scale describing the turbulence decay to that of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.  Preliminary low-resolution results using our start-up allocation shows that, surprisingly, the initial growth rates of bubble and spikes decrease in the presence of an isotropic velocity field in front of them.\n' },

These anomalies in isobaric heat capacity give rise to large enhancements in the thermal energy storage potential of supercritical fluids, as quantified by isobaric heat capacity.  Increased knowledge of the magnitude of isobaric heat capacity anomalies, and their location with respect to temperature and pressure could allow supercritical fluids to serve as a source of thermal energy storage.  Our research group is currently elucidating this area of thermodynamics by taking experimental measurements of the isobaric heat capacity anomalies of pure substances and mixtures, and calculating the isobaric heat capacity anomalies from data generated by molecular simulations, since experiments at the temperature and pressure conditions where anomalies occur are difficult and expensive to conduct.  Molecular simulations to gather data used to predict anomalies in isobaric heat capacity at a variety of temperatures and pressures will take 3,000 computational hours to complete on 1 node of Stampede.  A startup allocation on XSEDE will allow us to use molecular simulation to determine the accuracy of these simulations in the prediction of the isobaric heat capacity anomalies of a binary mixture of carbon dioxide and ethanol.

Each project will be able to answer one long-standing question with the most accurate radiation transfer algorithm.\n\nFirst, global radiation MHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks. These simulations can tell us the global structures of radiation dominated accretion disks by calculating the turbulence from magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and radiation transfer self-consistently. Our goal is to study how the thermal instability in the radiation pressure dominated regime changes the structures of the disk. By changing the accretion rate, we will also be able to study three different kinds of accretion flows. Specific intensities from these simulations will be able to compare with observations directly. The new radiation transfer algorithm we have developed is a significant improvement over traditional diffusion approximation or M1 closure. \n\nSecond, dynamics of the super-Eddington envelope of massive stars. These simulations will\nexplore convection in the radiation pressure dominated regime, including the stability of \na density inversion that  develops due to super-Eddington radiation flux.\nThe primary objective is to constrain the  poorly understood structure and stability of massive star envelopes, which in turns will help to understand the physics of mass loss. \nThis is expected to significantly improve our understanding of the evolution and death of massive stars.\n\nThird, radiation feedback on giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We will calculate the evolution and disruption of GMCs under irradiation from young stars. As radiation feedback is believed to play an important role in the regulation of the star formation rate in the galaxies, these simulations will allow us to better assess and quantify the role of radiation forces and heating.  In particular,  we will better understand how radiation couples with dust and gas in star forming environments, with the aim of improving the sub-grid models in large scale cosmological simulations. \n\nAll the three projects require accurate treatment of the radiation transfer, \nand coupling both the radiation energy and momentum source terms to the MHD equations.     \nWe have developed two new radiation-transfer modules in the well-tested MHD code Athena \nso that we can use the best suitable method for each project. Our calculations do not make the approximations used by other radiation hydro/MHD simulations in the literature (such as flux limited diffusion and M1).

We have developed a simulation approach that directly compares the relative kinetics of partner recognition for natively unfolded peptides and their exact, preorganized analogues.

As a result, the study of the exospheric sodium distribution (both neutral and ionized) can help to link the dynamical processes occurring in the exosphere and magnetosphere and sources on the surface to in situ, remote sensing and ground-based observations. \n\nBecause collisions are negligible in Mercurys exosphere, groups of atoms can maintain energy distributions characteristic of their sources.

    abstract: 'Traditional alloys used in engineering applications, including steels and aluminum alloys, are formed of a primary constituent (solvent) element with other elements added in relatively small quantities to enhance material properties.  However, the inclusion of large quantities of alloying elements tends to lead to the formation of intermetallics, rather than a single solid solution, which can dramatically reduce ductility and mechanical processing ability. We are developing novel high entropy alloys (HEAs), which, unlike traditional alloys, have four or more elements in roughly equiatomic proportions. Examples of these alloys have demonstrated mechanical properties greatly exceeding those of conventional engineering metals. However, the mechanisms by which these complex alloys are formed and improved properties achieved are not well understood. Our overall goal is to develop an experimentally-validated, systematic model based on first-principles calculations to enable further development of HEA systems. This research is supported by NSF grant OISE-1261525. The PI and undergraduate students have implemented methods using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to enable computation of partial phase diagrams of HEA alloy systems and the elastic constants of specific alloys. We are in the process of implementing methods to calculate stacking fault energy, Peierls stress, and flow stress as well. Several of these properties can be experimentally verified and are potentially predictive of high performance materials. We have already successfully used VASP to predict crystal structures, phase diagrams, and elastic properties for single elements and well-characterized binary alloys. As we move to simulating HEAs, we require more computational resources than are available to us at Harvey Mudd College. We request XSEDE resources to run our simulations on several alloy families of interest. ' },

The University of Colorado Colorado Springs, in collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory, is currently working on neutral gas heating via non-resonant pulsed optical lattices formed by counter-propagating laser pulses.  This experimentation is greatly enhanced by complimentary numerical simulation.  Using the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo method for statistical gas dynamic simulation, the simulations proposed will elucidate the kinetic phenomenon at the core of the interaction between a neutral atmospheric gas and high intensity pulsed optical lattices (lasers).  Current experimental capabilities in diagnosing the underlying mechanisms are limited by the fast time-scales and small length-scales of the interaction.  Numerical simulations are not similarly limited and can give data (e.g. velocity and internal energy distributions) inaccessible to experiment.  In pairing the proposed simulations with existing experimental data, this proposal seeks to gain an inside look at the micro-scale molecular interaction (both molecule-molecule and molecule-laser) which drive the experimentally observed phenomena.  The code used for these simulations is SMILE, a thoroughly tested gas dynamic simulation package written in MPI Fortran 77 and specially modified to simulated the laser-gas interaction of interest.  This simulation tool has been used extensively for similar simulations on DoD HPC facilities, demonstrating the PIs expertise in performing the proposed work.  Two test cases were run on TACC Lonestar and TACC Ranger.  A total simulation time of 175,000 SU on the TACC Lonestar system (or 370,000 SU on Ranger) is being requested to perform the proposed simulations.

It is also technologically important for ultrafast optical and electronic switches as the transition happens on a femtosecond time scale. However, prospects for some applications of VO2 have been clouded by both the much slower monoclinic-to-rutile structural transition (MRT) that accompanies the IMT and questions about the role of defects in the IMT, especially in thin-film geometries. \nTo address these two challenges, the PIs group is currently carrying out experimental studies under NSF support (DMR12-07507 and potentially EECS-1209740), which include:\n(1) Growing VO2 films in the M1 and M2 (a second monoclinic insulating phase) phases by various scalable techniques and comparing the physical and optical properties; \n(2) Correlating the effects of nanoscale morphology, crystallinity, substrate and applied fields with the formation and relaxation dynamics of the metallic phase; and\n(3) Measuring the time-dependent dielectric function of VO2 with femtosecond resolution to link the physical properties of VO2 films to the dynamics of ultrafast switching. \nFirst-principle calculations have provided valuable information for elucidating the underlying mechanism of experimental studies of VO2. Under previous NSF support (ECE-0801980), the PI and collaborators observed a narrowed hysteresis window of metal-insulator transition in strained multi-domain VO2 nanoparticles and performed first-principles density functional theory calculations to explore its microscopic origin. These calculations showed that the formation of oxygen vacancies is greatly enhanced at the grain-boundaries of VO2, suggesting that the hysteresis window is narrowed by oxygen vacancies that nucleate the phase transition. \nEncouraged by the previous success in utilizing theoretical calculations, here we propose to employ first-principles density functional theory to elucidate the roles of defects in the optical properties of VO2 films fabricated by scalable techniques (electron-beam evaporation, sputtering and pulsed-laser deposition). Defects of interest include oxygen vacancies and dopants such as tungsten, chromium, and titanium. We will calculate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of these defects, both at the surfaces of films and underneath the surface on both M1 and M2 phases. The effects of crystallinity and substrate (glass, silicon, sapphire and titania) will also be taken into account. The results will be analyzed together with our experimental data. \nWe will adopt the hybrid DFT method in the calculations to reproduce the experimental bandgap of VO2.

Atmospheric models, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ), are used to estimate the atmospheric concentration of pollutants such as PM2.5. Sensitivity analysis of these models has long been limited to finite difference and regression-based methods, both of which require many computationally intensive model simulations to link changes in output with perturbations in input. In order to calculate the sensitivity of PM2.5concentrations to emissions from individual sources from two source sectors, we utilize the Decoupled Direct Method in three dimensions (DDM-3D), an advanced sensitivity analysis tool recently implemented in CMAQ. DDM-3D allows calculation of sensitivity coefficients within a single simulation, eliminating the need for multiple model runs. However, while the output provides results for a variety of input perturbations in a single simulation, the processing time for each run is dramatically increased compared to simulations conducted without the DDM-3D module. We apply this advanced and sophisticated technique within the CMAQ model to assess sensitivities due to a) individual airport emissions, b) residential fuel combustion sources by state and c) select number of individual power plants in the U.S.  Based upon preliminary work performed for airport emissions, we have a design of experiments wherein we can model 6 different precursor emissions from 139 individual airports in multiple groups of CMAQ simulations, wherein we group airports such that plumes from no two airports intersect with each other. Use of the XSEDE Stampede computing cluster allows us to calculate sensitivity coefficients for a large number of input parameters, that that would be possible otherwise.  We will expand this design to perform the modeling for two different projects, but using identical core scientific tools (CMAQ/DDM-3D) to compute sensitivity coefficients that may be then be used to derive policy-relevant information. Using CMAQ/DDM-3D allows for a much wider variety of ad-hoc aviation policy scenarios to be generated and evaluated than would be possible using other sensitivity analysis methods or smaller-scaled computing systems. The results from this project will help with achieving the following objectives: a) quantify the individual contributions from major airports in the U.S. to PM2.5 levels to assess policy options that involve differential growth patterns, and b) quantify the environmental and public health benefits of reduced residential energy consumption, and related energy efficiency.' },

However, little is known about the fundamental behavior and properties of defects and dopants in strained Si layers and their interfaces with a-SiO2, (let alone high-k dielectrics). \nWe perform first principles calculations to determine: structure, stability, and bonding of defect and dopant clusters in amorphous/strained Si layers; formation and diffusion of mobile defect and defect-dopant complexes in strained Si layers and in the vicinity of a-c Si interfaces; and defect annihilation and dopant precipitation at strained-Si/a-SiO2 interfaces. \nWe perform first principles based classical molecular dynamics (or ab inito tight binding molecular dynamics, if necessary) simulations to examine complex dynamics occurring in amorphous Si.

Currently, however, there is still a major gap between the level of predictability and actual prediction skill, which can be attributed to both inadequate model physics and inaccurate initial state. This proposal requests computational resource to improve the seasonal monsoon prediction, using the version 2 of the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), which is the current operational climate prediction model at the National Centers for Environmental Predictions. We concentrate on improving the ocean initialization of the forecast system, where most of the memory for seasonal predictability resides. For this purpose, we will conduct a set of 28-year (1979-2009) hindcast experiments, using our newly developed strategy of multiple analysis ensemble (MAE) initialization of ocean. It is expected that the MAE strategy will significantly reduce the effect of the inherent uncertainty in current ocean analyses and thus improve the seasonal prediction skill of the sea surface temperature (SST) in not only the tropical eastern Pacific, but also the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, which will further lead to improved Indian Monsoon prediction. A set of the idealized initialization experiments will also be conducted to help evaluate the effects of the model systematic bias. Furthermore, some sensitivity experiments will be conducted to examine the relative contributions to the monsoon prediction by the SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, Indian and Atlantic basins respectively, as well as the influences of the atmospheric model resolution on the tropical air-sea interaction.

These include: (1) the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from high-redshift galaxies which host stars and miniquasars; (2) the photoevaporation of minihalos during reionization and its effect on reionization; (3) the suppression of dwarf galaxies by reionization; (4) the heavy element enrichment of the IGM by SN-driven explosions and galactic winds from dwarf galaxies; (5) a comparison of the effects of reionization by starlight versus quasars; (6) the effect of feedback on the halo density profile, in relation to "cuspy core" crisis of the standard CDM model.\r\n\r\nWe propose to run high-resolution N-body and hydrodynamics simulation. The code we are going to use primarily on Maverick is N-body, TVD hydrodynamics code, using OpenMP parallelization scheme. \r\n\r\nWe will simulate the photoevaporation of minihalos by the ionization fronts which reionized the IGM, the first 3D cosmological gas dynamical simulations which self-consistently include radiative transfer, using a newly developed Eulerian code with Adaptive Mesh Refinement. We will also apply our new and improved ASPH/P3M method to simulate the effect of SN-driven explosions during galaxy formation.\r\n\r\nPhD. graduate student, Jun Koda, is working on the N-body simulation of Self-Interacting Dark Matter. The simulation involves large number of self-gravitating N-body particles (~512 cube) with Monte Carlo random scattering. The density profile halos -- gravitationally bound systems -- in the universe is our primary interest. The result of the simulation will be compared with observations and verify or constrain the range of valid value of scattering cross section. The simulation will be done for many different mass range, from cluster of galaxies scale to dwarf galaxy scale, and with three different cross sections 0.5 to 5 cm2/g.' },

Myosin-Is comprise the largest unconventional myosin family found in humans (eight genes), and its large size and expression profile distinguish it as one of the most diverse.  Myosin-Is physically link cell membranes to the underlying actin cytoskeleton where they play essential roles in powering membrane dynamics, membrane trafficking, and mechanical signal-transduction.  Myosin-Is show remarkable diversity in their cellular function, which is mediated by their diverse biophysical properties, which includes dynamic tension sensing, membrane-attachment, and unique regulatory modes.  Our goal is to provide the biochemical and biophysical foundation for understanding the molecular physiology of this important class of motors.  One important aim is to define the structural origin of myosin-I force sensing from a recently obtained crystal structure of myo1b in its apo conformation and from 8A cryoEM electron densities of myo1b bound to actin in its rigor and ADP conformations.  The transition between ADP and rigor states determines the force sensitivity of myo1b. We have preliminary models of the ADP and rigor structures of myo1b bound to actin using MDFF and NAMD and propose using XSEDE to refine these models and estimate the kinetics of the transtion over a range of forces using NAMD and SMD.' },

    abstract: 'This proposal requests Xsede resources for the two investigations in the area of biophysics. Specifically, we aim at contrasting the roles of asparagine and glutamine in the aggregation of prion-like proteins and investigating free energies of CAG-based trinucleotide repeats.\n\nSequences rich in glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) are intrinsically disordered in monomeric form, but can aggregate into highly ordered amyloids as seen in Q/N-rich prion domains (PrD). Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates rich in beta-sheet structures that can self-propagate through protein-conformational chain reactions. It has been shown that tuning the amount of Ns and Qs in yeast PrDs results in very different effects: N-rich mutants lead to non-pathological self-seeding amyloids while Q-rich mutants lead to toxic nonamyloid structures. These structures preferences have been explained in terms of an enhanced beta-hairpin turn propensity of Ns over Qs. We have considered a variety of N/Q-rich peptides, including the sequences found in the yeast Sup35 PrDs, in parallel and antiparallel beta-sheet aggregates and probed all the possible steric-zipper interfaces to determine their relative stability. Our  current preliminary results show that polyQ aggregates are more stable than polyN aggregate, although when other amino acids are present as in Sup35 PrD that latter seems to be preferred. We have already explored much of phase space associated with this problem but request Xsede resources in order to enhance our statistics for this problem. \n\nTurning to our second scientific problem, we note that simple sequence repeats consist of units of one to six nucleotides that may be repeated up to thirty or more times. Trinucleotide repeats (TRs) constitute the most common type of simple sequence repeats in the exome\nof all eukaryotic genomes. In DNA, TRs may be neutral sequences or have several regulatory roles in gene expression. RNA TRs in the nucleus may regulate splicing, maturation and transport, while in the cytoplasm they regulate mRNA stabilty and transition. The incidence of specific sorts of TRs varies greatly between genomes, underscoring the vital role of TRs in genome evolution. Currently, it is estimated that the rate of length mutations in some simple repeats is about 100,000 times higher than that of a single point mutation. This can lead to frequent polymorphisms in coding of the genes and the rapid expansion of amino acid repeats. We are currently aiming to investigate fundamental aspects of TRs with a focus on their conformations, free energies and relative stability of associated atypical structures. In particular, using AMBER software which we have developed we aim to focus on CAG-based TRs.\n\nThis is first request for Xsede computational resources from a group with considerable high-performance computing experience. To date, we have been using local resources (our own group as well as NC State resources), but the scientific problems have outgrown our current\ncomputing resources. We note that the two scientific problems described here are quite feasible with modest resources requested: we already have preliminary data for both problems. However, more resources are needed to bring our studies into a publishable form. In addition, this will give our group valuable Xsede experience. Simulations will be carried out by 2 graduate students and 1 postdoc, which will be added to project when approved.' },

    abstract: 'One defining goal of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation field is to accurately predict the binding free energy of a ligand-receptor complex to within 1 kcal/mol or better of the experimental value.\tAn extraordinary number of algorithms and approaches have been developed to achieve this (umbrella sampling, steered MD, thermodynamic integration, MMPBSA, linear interaction energy, etc). The limiting factor for all these approaches is the force field used to model the ligand-receptor complex of interest. In the past, force field development goals have focused on either accurately reproducing experimental data for large biomolecules (i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates) or predicting the free energy of solvation of small drug-like molecules. We are submitting this research request in order to enable a third approach, namely, to address force field limitations in the context of host-guest model systems. In contrast to the previous approaches, we will evaluate the accuracy of force fields to predict biomolecular association directly by using umbrella sampling simulations to remove a guest from a host binding cavity.  From these simulations, free energies and enthalpies can be computed and compared to reference experimental values determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The host molecules we will study consist of a variety of modified and unmodified cyclodextrins for which highly accurate ITC data exists for numerous drug-like guests. The small size of a host-guest model system, around 7,000 atoms in explicit solvent, allows for very rapid simulation speeds and quick convergence of the properties of interest.  Given the large capacity of XSEDE resources, we can package a large number of homogeneously sized, umbrella sampling sub-jobs into a single large job that will enable quick turnaround needed for force field testing. We will be using the AMBER simulation software to perform MD simulations. We are requesting allocation on Keeneland, Kraken, and Stampede as we expect these resources will best fit our needs in the future large-scale project. The Co-PI, Niel Henriksen, has extensive knowledge of AMBER software and its deployment and usage on XSEDE resources.' },

Many of the alternative energy sources being considered to reduce our dependence upon fossil fuels are limited by material properties.  Examples include photovoltaic materials for energy production from sunlight, catalysts for energy conversion to and from chemical fuels, and storage in the form of electrochemical energy in batteries.  The key to designing new materials is a good understanding of the relationship between the material structure and its function.  Theory and modeling are playing an increasingly important role in determining these structure-function relationships.  In the field of catalysis, for example, the binding energy of chemicals to a catalyst surface have been shown to be good descriptors of catalytic activity.  For Li-ion battery materials, the binding of Li determines the cell voltage and diffusion barriers determine the potential current density.  Enabled with reactivity descriptors, computational methods can be used to rapidly screen and search for new materials.  In this project, existing collaborations with synthetic and analytical chemists will be leveraged to validate reactivity descriptors on functional materials for energy conversion and storage.  Specifically, nanoparticle catalysts for oxygen reduction, high capacity cathode materials for Li batteries, and doped oxides for photovoltaic applications will be targeted. The use of computational screening and gradient-based optimization in chemical compound space will then be used to predict new materials with improved function.  Through a close collaboration between theory and experiment, this approach will reduce the slow trial-and-error process of materials discovery and move towards the goal of materials-by-design.' },
